+
+   The viewer is implemented along the following design principles:
+
+   Terminology: a "paragraph" is the text between two adjacent newline characters. A "line" or
+   "row" is a visual row on the screen. In wrap mode, the viewer formats a paragraph into one or
+   more lines.
+
+   The parser-formatter is designed to be stateless across paragraphs. This is so that we can walk
+   backwards without having to reparse the whole file (although we still need to reparse and
+   reformat the whole paragraph, but it's a lot better).
+
+   The parser-formatter, however, needs to carry a state across lines. Currently this state
+   contains:
+
+    - The logical column (as if we didn't wrap). This is used for handling TAB characters after a
+      wordwrap consistently with less.
+
+    - Whether the last nroff character was bold or underlined. This is used for displaying the
+      ambiguous _\b_ sequence consistently with less.
+
+    - Whether the desired way of displaying a lonely combining accent or spacing mark is to place
+      it over a dotted circle (we do this at the beginning of the paragraph of after a TAB), or to
+      ignore the combining char and show replacement char for the spacing mark (we do this if e.g.
+      too many of these were encountered and hence we don't glue them with their base character).
+
+    - (This state needs to be expanded if e.g. we decide to print verbose replacement characters
+      (e.g. "<U+0080>") and allow these to wrap around lines.)
+
+   The state also contains the file offset, as it doesn't make sense to ever
+   know the state without knowing the corresponding offset.
+
+   The state depends on various settings (viewer width, encoding, nroff mode, charwrap or wordwrap
+   mode (if we'll have that one day) etc., needs to be recomputed if any of these changes.
+
+   Walking forwards is usually relatively easy both in the file and on the screen. Walking
+   backwards within a paragraph would only be possible in some special cases and even then it would
+   be painful, so we always walk back to the beginning of the paragraph and reparse-reformat from
+   there.
+
+   (Walking back within a line in the file would have at least the following difficulties: handling
+   the parser state; processing invalid UTF-8; processing invalid nroff (e.g. what is "_\bA\bA"?).
+   Walking back on the display: we wouldn't know where to display the last line of a paragraph, or
+   where to display a line if its following line starts with a wide (CJK or Tab) character. Long
+   story short: just forget this approach.)
+
+   Most important variables:
+
+    - dpy_start: Both in unwrap and wrap modes this points to the beginning of the topmost
+      displayed paragraph.
+
+    - dpy_text_column: Only in unwrap mode, an additional horizontal scroll.
+
+    - dpy_paragraph_skip_lines: Only in wrap mode, an additional vertical scroll (the number of
+      lines that are scrolled off at the top from the topmost paragraph).
+
+    - dpy_state_top: Only in wrap mode, the offset and parser-formatter state at the line where
+      displaying the file begins is cached here.
+
+    - dpy_wrap_dirty: If some parameter has changed that makes it necessary to reparse-redisplay
+      the topmost paragraph.
+
+   In wrap mode, the three variables "dpy_start", "dpy_paragraph_skip_lines" and "dpy_state_top"
+   are kept consistent. Think of the first two as the ones describing the position, and the third
+   as a cached value for better performance so that we don't need to wrap the invisible beginning
+   of the topmost paragraph over and over again. The third value needs to be recomputed each time a
+   parameter that influences parsing or displaying the file (e.g. width of screen, encoding, nroff
+   mode) changes, this is signaled by "dpy_wrap_dirty" to force recomputing "dpy_state_top" (and
+   clamp "dpy_paragraph_skip_lines" if necessary).
+
+   blahblahblah...
+
+   Goals: Always display simple scripts, double wide (CJK), combining accents and spacing marks
+   (often used e.g. in Devanagari) perfectly. Make the arrow keys always work correctly.
+
+   Absolutely non-goal: RTL.
+
+   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+   Help integration
+
+   I'm planning to port the help viewer to this codebase.
+
+   Splitting at sections would still happen in the help viewer. It would either copy a section, or
+   set force_max and a similar force_min to limit displaying to one section only.
+
+   Parsing the help format would go next to the nroff parser. The colors, alternate character set,
+   and emitting the version number would go to the "state". (The version number would be
+   implemented by emitting remaining characters of a buffer in the "state" one by one, without
+   advancing in the file position.)
+
+   The active link would be drawn similarly to the search highlight. Other than that, the viewer
+   wouldn't care about links (except for their color). help.c would keep track of which one is
+   highlighted, how to advance to the next/prev on an arrow, how the scroll offset needs to be
+   adjusted when moving, etc.
+
+   Add wrapping at word boundaries to where wrapping at char boundaries happen now.
