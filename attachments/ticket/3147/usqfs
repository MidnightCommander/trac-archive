# AAAAAAAAAA NNN OOOOOOOO GGGGGGGG SSSSSSSS DATETIME [PATH/]FILENAME [-> [PATH/]FILENAME[/]]]
#
# where (things in [] are optional):
#
# AAAAAAAAAA is the permission string like in ls -l
# NNN        is the number of links
# OOOOOOOO   is the owner (either UID or name)
# GGGGGGGG   is the group (either GID or name)
# SSSSSSSS   is the file size
# FILENAME   is the filename
# PATH       is the path from the archive's root without the leading slash (/)
# DATETIME   has one of the following formats:
#            Mon DD hh:mm, Mon DD YYYY, Mon DD YYYY hh:mm, MM-DD-YYYY hh:mm
#
#            where Mon is a three letter English month name, DD is day 1-31,
#            MM is month 01-12, YYYY is four digit year, hh is hour and
#            mm is minute.
#
# If the -> [PATH/]FILENAME part is present, it means:
#
# If permissions start with an l (ell), then it is the name that symlink
# points to. (If this PATH starts with a MC vfs prefix, then it is a symlink
# somewhere to the other virtual filesystem (if you want to specify path from
# the local root, use local:/path_name instead of /path_name, since /path_name
# means from root of the archive listed).
#
# If permissions do not start with l, but number of links is greater than one,
# then it says that this file should be a hardlinked with the other file.
