-1 Getting started
-
-1.1 What is Midnight Commander?
-
-   GNU Midnight Commander is a user-friendly yet powerful file manager
-   and visual shell, useful to novice and guru alike.  It provides a
-   clear, user-friendly, and somewhat protected interface to a Unix
-   system while making many frequent file operations more efficient and
-   preserving the full power of the command prompt.  After some
-   practice, you will wonder how you could ever live without it.
-
-1.2 Does it run on my machine?
-
-   GNU Midnight Commander runs on POSIX (Unix-like) operating systems,
-   such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, HP-UX and others.  It
-   can also be compiled under Cygwin on Windows.
-
-   GNU Midnight Commander uses GNU Autoconf which should automatically
-   configure it for every Unix clone.  Following configurations have
-   been tested in the past (this list is very old):
-
-     * i386-*-linux1.x, 2.x
-     * alpha-linux-linux2
-     * sparc-linux-linux2.x
-     * sparc64-linux-linux2.1
-     * mips-sgi-irix5.x, 6.x
-     * mips-dec-ultrix4.3
-     * rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5
-     * sparc-sun-sunos4.1
-     * sparc-sun-solaris2.3, 2.4, 2.5
-     * sparc-sun-netbsd1.0
-     * hppa-hp-hpux9
-     * hppa-hp-hpux7
-     * m68k-apple-aux
-     * unixware
-     * mc88110-aviion-dgux5.4R2.01
-     * i386-*-sco3.2v4.2
-     * i386-*-sco3.2v5
-
-1.3 Does it work with my terminal?
-
-   Yes, it does.
-
-   Because GNU Midnight Commander is a full screen program it doesn't
-   run on dummy terminals but anything more advanced will do (like
-   vt100).  If your terminal works with vi, emacs, elm or pine it will
-   work with GNU Midnight Commander.
-
-1.4 What else do I need to run MC?
-
-   You need a POSIX (Unix compatible) operating system.  If you are
-   running Windows, use Cygwin.
-
-   To compile any edition you need to have glib 1.2.x or newer
-   installed.  It's available at ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/.  If you
-   don't have glib installed already, please note that glib 2.x is much
-   harder to compile, so your first choice should be glib 1.2.10.
-
-   If you want to use mouse on the Linux console you need the gpm daemon
-   from ftp://ftp.systemy.it/pub/develop/.  You need nothing extra to
-   use mouse on xterm.
-
-   If you do not want to use the S-Lang library you could try using
-   ncurses version 4.1 and above.
-
-1.5 Is GNU Midnight Commander Public Domain? Copyrighted?
-
-   Midnight Commander is under GNU Public License which basically means
-   that you may freely copy, change and distribute it, but that you may
-   not impose any restrictions on further distribution, and that you
-   must make the source code available.  This is not the same as Public
-   Domain.  For details, the GNU license is included in GNU Midnight
-   Commander source distribution (the COPYING file).
-
-   Midnight Commander is now officially a part of the GNU project.
-   All the authors of GNU Midnight Commander have given all their rights
-   on the program to the Free Software Foundation.
-
-1.6 Where can I get GNU Midnight Commander?
-
-   The main site is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/mc/
-
-1.7 I don't have FTP access.  Where can I get MC?
-
-   Most GNU/Linux distributions include GNU Midnight Commander.  For
-   example, Debian, Mandrake, Red Hat, Slackware and SuSE.
-
-1.8 I cannot compile MC.  What should I do?
-
-   Make sure you have read the INSTALL file in the sources.  Report the
-   error messages exactly as they appear, mention the versions of your
-   OS, your compiler and whatever else software you think is relevant.
-   If you have compile problems in the VFS code, try disabling it by
-   using "--without-vfs" switch.  As the last resort, you can use
-   precompiled binaries from the GNU Midnight Commander website.
-
-
-2 Keyboard
-
-2.1 What does documentation mean with the C-?, M-? and F? keys?
-
-   GNU Midnight Commander documentation uses emacs style names for
-   keyboard keys.
-
-   C stands for the Ctrl key.  For example, C-f means that you should
-   hold down the Ctrl key and press the f key.
-
-   M stands for the Meta key.  Your terminal might call it Alt or
-   Compose instead of Meta.  For example, M-f means that you should hold
-   down the Meta/Alt/Compose key and press the f key.  If your terminal
-   doesn't have Meta, Alt or Compose or they don't work you can use Esc.
-   For M-f press the Esc key and then press the f key.
-
-   Sometimes Ctrl and Alt are used instead of C and M for simplicity.
-   Keep in mind that Alt can actually be Meta on some keyboards.
-
-   F? stands for a function key.  If your terminal doesn't have function
-   keys or they don't work you can use Esc.  For example, for F3 press
-   the Esc key and then press the 3 key.
-
-2.2 Why don't function keys (or some other key) work?
-
-   Your terminfo or termcap database has missing or incorrect
-   definitions for function keys.  Type "mc -V" to see what terminal
-   database is being used.  If the result is "using the S-Lang library
-   with terminfo database" and you are using a very old terminfo
-   database, consider installing one of the enhanced terminfo files
-   included in GNU Midnight Commander source distribution.  For example,
-   if you are using xterm type "tic xterm.ti".
-
-   If the result is "using the S-Lang library with termcap database" you
-   should fix your /etc/termcap database.
-
-   Up-to-date termcap and terminfo databases are available here:
-
-     http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/terminfo/
-     ftp://dickey.his.com/ncurses/
-
-   You can force Midnight Commander to use the termcap database by
-   giving --with-termcap option to the configure script.  The default
-   is to use terminfo.
-
-   If you don't have permissions to edit terminal databases you can use
-   Learn keys feature of Midnight Commander instead.  Press Esc 9 o k
-   and follow instructions.
-
-   If all else fails you can emulate function keys by first pressing the
-   ESC key and then one of the number keys.  For example, if you want to
-   produce F9, press ESC, then 9.  If you don't have a ESC key on your
-   keyboard you can try alt-9 or meta-9.
-
-2.3 How do I use function keys F11 to F20?
-
-   These are normally mapped to function keys F1 to F10 with Shift held,
-   e.g. function key F13 can be activated by pressing Shift-F3.  You can
-   define the keys this way in the Options->Learn Keys dialog.  The
-   convention for PC keyboards is that F11-20 always means Shift with
-   F1-10.
-
-   You may find that on the Linux console with some keyboard layouts
-   Shift-Fn is interpreted as F(n+12), not as F(n+10).  This is a result
-   of non-uniformity of keyboard layouts.  This is not an intended
-   behavior and it may be fixed some day.  In the meantime, use "Learn
-   Keys" to remedy this inconvenience.
-
-2.4 Why does the ESC key behave funny?
-
-   Midnight Commander uses the ESC key as a prefix for simulating the
-   Meta and Alt keys (for terminals which don't have Meta or Alt, see
-   the three previous questions).  For example, pressing ESC-a is the
-   same as pressing Meta-a.  In addition most terminals use ESC for
-   internal representation of arrow keys, function keys and other
-   enhanced keys.  If you want to use ESC to cancel things you have to
-   press it twice i.e. ESC-ESC.  If you find this cumbersome you can
-   generally use F10 to cancel.  Alternatively turn on the old_esc_mode
-   setting in the ~/.mc/ini file.  The old_esc_mode setting makes ESC
-   work as a prefix only if another key is pressed within 0.5 seconds.
-   After 0.5 seconds the ESC key cancels.  There is no way to make ESC
-   cancel immediately (if we want to be able to use arrows keys and
-   function keys).
-
-2.5 How can I add the plus sign (+) on the command line?
-
-   Press C-q first, then press the + sign.
-
-   The plus key is the hotkey for the select files command.  If you want
-   to add a literal plus on to the command line you must quote it by
-   pressing C-q first.
-
-   Another common key which needs the C-q prefix is backslash "\".
-
-2.6 C-o doesn't work!
-
-   Maybe C-o is a stty control character on your terminal.  See man stty
-   for details on how to list and change stty control characters.
-
-2.7 What 'keys' are the "a1" and "c1" keys mentioned in the manual?
-
-   The "a1" key is the key which has the "a1" caption on it.
-
-   The "c1" key is the key which has the "c1" caption on it.
-
-   If you have to ask what these two keys are your keyboard hasn't
-   probably got them.  Actually, I have never seen a keyboard which has
-   got them.
-
-2.8 How do I change the key bindings?
-
-   There is no generic way to reconfigure the key bindings.  You can use
-   the "Learn Keys" dialog to assign keys to some actions listed in that
-   dialog.  However, most actions cannot be redefined to use different
-   keys.
-
-
-3 Mouse
-
-3.1 How do I enable mouse support?
-
-   Invoke mc like this (without quotes): "mc -x".  If this doesn't work
-   upgrade to a terminal which compatible with the Xterm mouse
-   sequences.
-
-   Alternatively, on Linux console you can use gpm.
-
-3.2 How do I cut and paste text with mouse?
-
-   Hold down shift key while using mouse to cut and paste.
-
-3.3 How do I get the extension dependent pop-up menu to pop up?
-
-   It was developed for the GNOME edition.  The text-mode edition
-   doesn't support this feature yet.
-
-
-4 Display
-
-4.1 Why do I keep getting "Terminal not powerful enough for SLang" or
-    "Terminal not powerful enough for SLsmg"?
-
-   This means that your terminfo databases do not contain the correct
-   definitions for your terminal.
-
-   You could try using a different terminal setting.  If you use csh or
-   tcsh:
-
-     setenv TERM vt100
-
-   or if you use sh, bash, ksh or zsh:
-
-     export TERM=vt100
-
-   If this doesn't help you can recompile MC to use termcap instead of
-   terminfo:
-
-     ./configure --with-termcap
-     make
-
-4.2 Why don't line drawing characters work?
-
-   Since version 4.0.13 there's the command line option -a to force use
-   of charaters +, |, - for line drawing (only available when compiled
-   with S-Lang).  Use the -a option if any of the suggestions below
-   doesn't help.
-
-   In general, there are three cases:
-     * Lines are shown as ASCII characters like this
-
-      +---------+
-      |         |
-      +---------+
-
-       This also happens when you use the -a option.  Other than that
-       possible reason is 1 or 2 (see below).
-
-     * Lines are shown as lower case characters like this
-
-      lqqqqqqqqqk
-      x         x
-      mqqqqqqqqqj
-
-       Possible reason is 1 or 2 (see below).
-
-     * Lines are shown as blanks or missing characters.  Possible reason
-       is 2 or 3 (see below).
-
-   The reason for the problem is one of following:
-
-    1. Your terminal might not support line drawing characters.  VT100
-       compatible terminals, rxvt and xterm and color_xterm do support
-       them.
-    2. Your terminfo or termcap database might have missing or incorrect
-       definitions for line drawing characters.  Set the acsc variable
-       in the terminfo database like this:
-       acsc=a\376k\277l\332m\300j\331n\305w\302v\301u\264t\303q\304x
-       \263h\2600\333
-       Don't forget issue 'tic' command.  This supposes you are using PC
-       character set.  The octal values might be different for other
-       character sets.  If you are using termcap instead of terminfo,
-       you should modify above solution appropriately.
-    3. Your terminal font might not support line drawing characters.
-       Try changing the font.
-
-   Here is Miguel's answer to Torben on this subject.
-
-   Torben:
-
-     When I load consolefonts/iso01.f16, I get perfectly right national
-     characters, but the line drawing characters in mc get wrong.  Is it
-     a mc problem, or is it a problem with the font? (I guess it is).
-
-     Is there a trick?
-
-   Miguel:
-
-     First of all, we should determine whether the font has line drawing
-     characters or not.
-
-     If it has line drawing characters, then a new terminfo entry should
-     be written for this specific case.  Let's call this linux-iso01.
-     The acsc variable should be modified to reflect which characters
-     are used to do the line drawing.
-
-     If it does not have line drawing characters, then we should get rid
-     of the switch to acsc sequences and make the acsc sequence be just
-     a mapping to the ugly +, -, |, - characters.
-
-     You can get your terminfo definition by running the infocmp
-     program, making the proper changes and running the tic program to
-     compile your new terminfo database.
-
-4.3 Can one use latin-1 characters without losing the lines?
-
-   Yes, you need a correct font and a correct termcap/terminfo database.
-
-   For font, if you use xterm try "xterm -fn fixed".
-
-   For termcap/terminfo database, change the acsc capability in the
-   database.
-
-4.4 I have problems with entering/viewing national characters!
-
-   Upgrade to version 4.0.12 or newer.
-
-   From the Options - Display Bits dialog select Full 8 bits or ISO
-   8859-1.  In addition, select 8 bit input from the same dialog.
-
-4.5 How can I get colors?
-
-   Invoke mc like this (without quotes): "mc -c".
-
-   If you get colors, be happy.
-
-   If your terminal stays black and white, your terminal doesn't support
-   color.  You might want to upgrade to a terminal which compatible with
-   the ANSI color sequences.
-
-   If your terminal goes completely black, see the next question.
-
-   More detailed answer:
-
-   Check that your terminal supports color.  color_xterm, rxvt and Linux
-   console do support, most other terminals don't.  You can test color
-   support with following simple C program:
-
-    #include <stdio.h>
-
-    int main (void){
-        printf ("\033[32m Hello world! \033[m\n");
-        return 0;
-    }
-
-   Compile and run it.  If you see "Hello world!" text in green your
-   terminal supports color, otherwise not (however, for color_xterm see
-   also the next question).
-
-   Check whether you are using Ncurses or the S-Lang library (type
-   "mc -V" to find out).
-
-   With S-Lang library you can force color support by setting the
-   environment variable COLORTERM to any value.
-
-   If you use ncurses library, check that your terminfo database
-   supports color.  If not, you should install one of the enhanced
-   terminfo databases included in GNU Midnight Commander source
-   distribution.
-
-   You might want to set the TERM environment variable so that you are
-   using the correct terminfo database or termcap entry.
-
-   If you use color_xterm (or rxvt) the correct value might be
-   xterm-color, xtermc or simply xterm.
-
-   If you use Linux console the correct value for TERM is linux or
-   console.
-
-4.6 My color_xterm goes completely (or partially) black!
-
-   Some color_xterm terminals define all colors as black instead of the
-   standard ANSI colors.  This makes them go completely black when you
-   try to use Midnight Commander with colors.
-
-   You will have to override the defaults.  Create a file
-   "color.defaults" which has the following contents:
-
-    color_xterm*color0:           Black
-    color_xterm*color1:           Red
-    color_xterm*color2:           Green
-    color_xterm*color3:           Yellow
-    color_xterm*color4:           Blue
-    color_xterm*color5:           Magenta
-    color_xterm*color6:           Cyan
-    color_xterm*color7:           White
-    color_xterm*background:       White
-    color_xterm*foreground:       Black
-
-   (replace color_xterm with the name of your color_xterm, color_xterm
-   mentions its name in its title bar)
-
-   Now type:
-
-    xrdb -merge color.defaults
-
-   Alternatively you can add the suggested contents of the
-   color.defaults file to your .Xdefaults or .Xresources file (or what
-   ever the name of your X configuration file is).  Or you can replace
-   your non-ANSI color_xterm with an ANSI color_xterm.
-
-4.7 Where can I get xterm or rxvt?
-
-   xterm is included with the X Window System, so you probably already
-   have it if you have X.  This version is not actively maintained, but
-   Thomas Dickey maintains his more advanced version of xterm at
-   ftp://dickey.his.com/xterm/
-
-   rxvt has its own site http://www.rxvt.org/ - get the latest version
-   there.
-
-4.8 I got colors working with MC but the other programs don't work at
-all anymore!
-
-   Midnight Commander uses terminfo database (if available) but many
-   other programs use termcap database.  If you set the TERM environment
-   variable to a value which has no corresponding entry in termcap
-   database those programs stop working.  You should add the new value
-   of TERM to the termcap database.
-
-   Example: If you have set TERM to xterm-color locate from /etc/termcap
-   the line which starts:
-
-    xterm|vs100|xterm terminal emulator
-
-   Change it to start:
-
-    xterm|xterm-color|vs100|xterm terminal emulator
-
-4.9 Why are there both terminfo and termcap? Wouldn't one database be
-enough?
-
-   You might want to read the Unix-Haters Handbook at
-   http://catalog.com/hopkins/unix-haters/handbook.html.  It lists many
-   more reasons why Unix sucks.
-
-   You can configure which terminal database you want to use with the
-   "--with-termcap" and "--with-terminfo" flags of configure.  If you
-   don't specify them, the configure script will try to use terminfo if
-   available otherwise it will use termcap.
-
-
-5 Graphical user interface
-
-5.1 Xview, Tk and Gnome editions?
-
-   Xview and Tk and GNOME editions have been removed from the sources.
-
-5.2 Why is MC linked with X libraries?
-
-   GNU Midnight Commander is linked with X libraries to read key
-   modifiers from the X Server.  It may be helpful to distinguish
-   between keys that the terminal emulator reports in the same way, e.g.
-   PgUp and Ctrl-PgUp.  Versions of GNU Midnight Commander after 4.6.0
-   will load X libraries dynamically on the systems that support it.
-
-
-6 Command line problems
-
-6.1 How do I stay in the last directory when I exit Midnight Commander?
-
-   See the description of the -P option in the Options section of the
-   manual.
-
-6.2 How can I access command line history?
-
-   Alt-h shows the last commands you executed from the command line.
-   Duplicates are suppressed from the history.  Commands executed from
-   the subshell prompt are not shown.
-
-   You can put previous commands to the command line with Alt-p.  Alt-n
-   moves you forward in history.
-
-   Since version 4.1.15 all the input widgets have permanent history.
-   You can summon the history listbox by pressing M-h.
-
-6.3 How can I complete commands, file names, variable names and so on?
-
-   Just press M-Tab.  Press M-Tab again to get a listbox if there are
-   multiple possible completions.
-
-6.4 I am using ksh.  Can I use functions defined in the .kshrc within
-MC?
-
-   Sorry, MC only supports bash, tcsh and zsh functions.  Ksh functions
-   are not supported because ksh lacks the necessary hooks needed for
-   subshell integration.
-
-   Switch to bash or zsh.  They are both quite compatible with ksh. 
-   Your ksh functions should work as such or after minimal changes.
-
-6.5 Is there any way to include additional options or hot keys to MC?
-
-   Yes, F2 invokes an user menu,  which is fully configurable.  You can
-   add any shell commands to the user menu.  See the mc(1) man page for
-   more info.
-
-   Another way to add functionality is the external panelize feature.
-   See the mc(1) man page for more info.
-
-   And finally, you can code any feature you want yourself.  MC source
-   code is free which means you can change it anyway you want.  There
-   are some limitations to make sure MC stays free.  See GNU General
-   Public License for details.
-
-6.6 When I use Ctrl-O I don't get a subshell.  How do I fix this?
-
-   Only bash, tcsh and zsh can be used as subshell.  Use one of those
-   shells as your default shell, and it will be used as subshell in GNU
-   Midnight Commander.
-
-6.7 Ctrl-O doesn't work at all.  What happens?
-
-   Ctrl-O works if either the subshell is used or the terminal can save
-   the output of the commands so it can be restored.  If neither is
-   true, there is absolutely nothing interesting behind the panels!
-
-   Only few terminals support screen saving.  It's xterm, rxvt and other
-   xterm-like terminals and virtual terminals on Linux and FreeBSD.
-
-
-7 Virtual file systems
-
-7.1 How can I see the contents of a tar archive?
-
-   If you use keyboard just move the selection bar on the tar file and
-   press enter.  If you use mouse just double-click on the tar file.
-
-   The recognized suffixes for tar archives are .tar, .tar.gz and .tgz.
-   You can also enter a tar archive by typing "cd filename#utar" where
-   filename is the name of the archive.  In this case, the suffix is not
-   important.
-
-7.2 How do I get out of a tar archive?
-
-   Just press enter on the toplevel ".." file or change to a non-tar
-   directory.  Just typing "cd" with no parameters is enough (it will
-   take you to your home directory).
-
-7.3 How do I do anonymous ftp with MC?
-
-   Just type "cd ftp://hostname" where hostname is the name of the host
-   you want to connect.  Alternatively, select FTP link from the Left or
-   Right menu and type the name of the host you want to connect.
-
-7.4 How do I do non-anonymous ftp with MC?
-
-   Non-anonymous ftp works just like the anonymous ftp but you give the
-   login name with the host name.  For example, type "cd
-   ftp://username@hostname".
-
-7.5 How do I close an ftp connection?
-
-   Just change to a non-ftp directory.  Simply typing "cd" with no
-   parameters is enough (it will take you to your home directory).
-
-   GNU Midnight Commander closes ftp connection automatically after a
-   timeout or on exit.  It's possible to force disconnect by selecting
-   "Command" -> "Active VFS List" in the menu and using the "Free VFSs
-   Now" button.
-
-7.6 Why aren't the contents of ftp panel updated?
-
-   Update is skipped because there would be a serious performance
-   penalty.  Constantly updating directory panels through a ftp
-   connection would take too much time.
-
-   You can use C-r to force an update.
-
-7.7 What kind of proxy server works with Midnight Commander?
-
-   There are two kinds of ftp proxies: proxies for ftp clients and
-   proxies for web browsers.
-
-   Midnight Commander only supports ftp proxies which are meant for ftp
-   clients.  Common WWW proxies (like Squid) are not supported.  A rule
-   of thumb is that if a ftp proxy requires a web browser, it won't work
-   with Midnight Commander.
-
-
-8 Other common problems
-
-8.1 When I try pasting to the internal editor, it indents the amount of
-indenting increases with each line!
-
-   Either turn off 'Return does autoindent' in the editor options or
-   update GNU Midnight Commander to version 4.6.0 or above - it doesn't
-   autoindent when you are holding Shift.
-
-8.2 Is it possible to use Colorer for syntax highlighting?
-
-   Yes if you submit the patch.  There are no legal problems with it
-   because it's licensed under GPL now.  The homepage of Colorer is
-   http://colorer.sourceforge.net/
-
-
-9 Other common problems
-
-9.1 Is there any way to 'bookmark' favorite ftp-fs links?
-
-   Use the directory hotlist.  Just press control-backslash.  If your
-   national keyboard layout doesn't have backslash key, just press the
-   control key with the key which is the backslash key in the English
-   keyboard layout.
-
-9.2 When I start Midnight Commander, nothing happens!
-
-   When MC is compiled with Samba support, have a look at the
-   "interfaces = ..." line in your smb.conf file. MC uses pretty old
-   Samba code that only expects IP addresses and host names there,
-   but not network interface names (like eth0). MC interprets these
-   names as host names and tries to resolve them using a DNS server.
-   To fix this, ask your system administrator to change the interface
-   names to their assigned IP addresses, or (untried) add the interface
-   names and their IP addresses to the /etc/hosts file.
-
-   First, invoke MC without subshell support: "mc -u".  If this helps
-   check the shell you are using.  Subshell support works best with
-   bash, although tcsh and zsh are also supported.  You might want to
-   upgrade your shell to a newer version.  If you use something else
-   than bash, tcsh or zsh, subshell support is disabled automatically.
-
-   If disabling subshell doesn't help, try to reconfigure MC with
-   "--with-included-slang" and "--with-termcap" options and recompile.
-   If this helps, something is wrong with your terminfo database or
-   shared S-Lang library.  For better terminfo databases see chapter 4
-   of this FAQ.  For a better S-Lang library, upgrade to a newer version
-   or keep using the "--with-included-slang" option.
-
-   Another reason is problems with gpm.  Try using "--nomouse" option to
-   see if it makes any difference.  Restarting gpm can help.  Sometimes
-   it's enough to move the mouse.
-
-   Also, if you have the DISPLAY environment variable set, but the X
-   server is unreachable (e.g. it's firewalled), this can also cause a
-   delay at startup.  Unset DISPLAY to see if that's the case.
-

-10 Development
-
-10.1 Who has written Midnight Commander?
-
-   Midnight Commander was started by Miguel de Icaza and he is the
-   maintainer of the package.  Other authors have joined the project
-   later:
-     * Mauricio Plaza (early releases)
-     * Janne Kukonlehto (joined Sep 27 1994)
-     * Radek Doulik (joined Oct 30 1994)
-     * Fred Leeflang (joined Nov 2 1994)
-     * Dugan Porter (joined Dec 1 1994)
-     * Jakub Jelinek (joined Feb 8 1995)
-     * Ching Hui (joined Jun 27 1995)
-     * Andrej Borsenkow (joined Jul 1996)
-     * Paul Sheer (joined Nov 1 1996)
-     * Norbert Warmuth
-     * Alex I. Tkachenko
-
-   Alessandro Rubini has been specially helpful with debugging and
-   enhancing of the mouse support.  John E. Davis has made his S-Lang
-   library available to us and answered many questions about it.
-
-   Many people have contributed bug reports, feature suggestions and
-   small code bits (alphabetical order):
-     * Thomasz Cholewo
-     * Juan Jose Ciarlante
-     * Alexander Dong (OS/2 port, NT port updates)
-     * Erwin van Eijk
-     * Torben Fjerdingstad
-     * Massimo Fontanelli
-     * Juan Grigera (NT port)
-     * Gerd Knorr
-     * Sergey Ya. Korshunoff
-     * Jean-Daniel Luiset
-     * Wim Osterholt
-     * Antonio Palama (old DOS port)
-     * Thomas Pundt
-     * Marcelo Roccasalva
-     * Ilya Rybkin
-     * Vadim Sinolits
-     * Jon Stevens
-     * Adam Tla/lka
-
-10.2 Do I dare to use a development version?
-
-   That's up to you to decide.  Development versions may have nasty bugs
-   at some points of time.  It's up to you to judge whether the new
-   features and fixes for the bugs you know outweigh the risk of unknown
-   bugs.
-
-10.3 How can I report a bug/request for a feature?
-
-   You might first want to get the newest development version to see if
-   the bug is fixed or the feature is added already.
-
-   Send your report/request to mc-devel@gnome.org or mc@gnome.org. 
-   These mailing lists are the most certain way to contact the
-   developers.  Remember to mention if you are not on the mailing list
-   to make sure that you will receive a copy of replies.
-
-   Give as much details as possible.  A too long message is a lot better
-   than a too short message.
-
-   For segmentation faults a stack backtrace is appreciated.  You can
-   produce stack backtrace as follows:
-     * If segmentation fault produced a core file:
-         1. Load the core file by typing "gdb mc core" or "dbx mc core".
-         2. Type "where".
-         3. Cut and paste the results to your message.
-     * If segmentation fault didn't produce a core file:
-         1. Load mc by typing "gdb mc" or "dbx mc".
-         2. Start mc by typing "run".
-         3. Try to reproduce the segmentation fault by doing whatever
-            you did last time when the segmentation fault occurred.
-         4. Type "where".
-         5. Cut and paste the results to your message.
-         6. For the future you might want to check out what is the
-            command in your shell to allow producing of the core files.
-            Usually it is "limit coredumpsize unlimited" or "ulimit
-            coredumpsize" or "ulimit -c unlimited".
-
-10.4 How can I join the development?
-
-   To join the development just code the feature you want to add and
-   send your patch for inclusion.  Email address is mc-devel@gnome.org.
-   Before you start coding check the latest development version.  It
-   might be that your feature has already been implemented.
-
-   Note that the authors of GNU Midnight Commander have given all their
-   rights on the program to the Free Software Foundation.  You will have
-   to do the same if you contribute non-trivial patches.  Otherwise we
-   have to reject your patches in order to avoid copyright problems.

-This document
-=============
-
-This document is a guide how to develop GNU Midnight Commander.  It's
-quite incomplete, but may be worth reading anyway.
-
-The document was written by Miguel de Icaza and reworked by Pavel
-Roskin.  Some parts were taken from the messages posted in the mailing
-lists.
-
-
-Compiling from CVS
-==================
-
-To compile GNU Midnight commander from CVS, the following software is
-required:
-
-Autoconf 2.52 and above (latest is recommended)
-Automake 1.5 and above (latest is recommended)
-Gettext 0.11.5 and above
-Glib 1.2.6 and above (2.x is recommended)
-
-It is recommended that all those tools are installed with the same
-prefix.  Make sure that the tools with the right version are first in
-PATH.
-
-Once you have the right tools, run `autogen.sh' - it will generate
-everything necessary for the build and run `configure'.  Arguments given
-to `autogen.sh' are passed to `configure'.  Then run `make' as usually.
-
-The distribution tarball is created by the command `make distcheck'. 
-This command can take a while.
-
-Currently snapshots are made on Debian unstable and use the versions of
-the tools from the unstable repository.  Yes, the rpm packages are made
-on Debian too.
-
-Note that the version of gettext doesn't affect the snapshot because the
-distributed files are installed by gettext from archives for the version
-used in the AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION macro, which is 0.11.5.
-
-
-
-Working with GNU Midnight Commander
-===================================
-
-Please use the CVS version.  It may be quite different from the released
-versions.  A lot of cleanup is going on.  The CVS version may be easier
-to understand, in addition to the obvious fact that the merging is
-easier with the CVS version.
-
-There are some tools in the maint directory on CVS.  They are not
-included with releases or snapshots.  You may be interested to look at
-them if you are going to work on the project for an extended period of
-time.  In particular, the release procedure is described there.
-
-In order to compile GNU Midnight Commander from a clean CVS checkout you
-should use autogen.sh instead of configure.  Arguments passed to
-autogen.sh are passed to configure after it's generated.
-
-GNU Midnight Commander uses Autoconf and Automake, with make it fairly
-portable.  However, GNU Make is strongly recommended for development
-because other versions of make may not track dependencies properly. 
-This is very important for correct compilation, especially if you change
-any header files.
-
-If you add or remove any files, please change Makefile.am in the same
-directory accordingly.  When doing significant changes in the tree
-structure, "make distcheck" is strongly recommended.
-
-If you have etags installed, you can run "make tags" and use tags in
-emacs to find functions or variables.  But you can also use the internal
-editor and the "Find File" command to find any text in the source tree.
-
-GNU Autoconf allows you to test several different configurations are
-once.  To do so, use the so called out-of-tree (or VPATH) compilation. 
-Create separate empty directories and run configure with full path from
-those directories, like this:
-
-cd /usr/local/src
-mkdir mc-slang
-mkdir mc-ncurses
-cd mc-slang
-/usr/local/src/mc/configure && make all
-cd ../mc-ncurses
-/usr/local/src/mc/configure --with-screen=ncurses && make all
-
-Please use the same indentation as other developers.  To indent a block,
-select in the internal editor and use Shift-F9 to call the external
-indent.  For historic reasons, GNU Midnight Commander used formatting
-that is not default for GNU Indent.  Please put following text to your
-~/.indent.pro file to make GNU Indent follow the style used in GNU
-Midnight Commander:
-
--kr -i4 -pcs -psl --ignore-newlines
-
-It's OK to indent the whole function if you edit it.  However, please
-refrain from it if you are posting your patch for review.  In this case
-you would save time of other developers if you only include significant
-changes.  The developer applying your patch can format the code for you.
-
-Please keep in mind that the VFS subsystem is licensed under LGPL, while
-the rest of the code uses GPL.
-
-
-Code structure - outline
-========================
-
-The code is located in following directories.
-
-vfs - Virtual File System.
-
-This library provides filesystem-like access to various data, such are
-archives and remote filesystems.  To use VFS, you should use wrappers
-around POSIX calls.  The wrappers have names composed from "mc_" and the
-standard name of the function.  For example, to open a file on VFS, use
-mc_open() instead.
-
-edit - the internal editor.
-
-This code has been contributed by Paul Sheer, the author of Cooledit. 
-The internal editor shares some code with Cooledit, but now it's
-developed as part of GNU Midnight Commander.
-
-src - the main part of the code.
-
-This code includes the dialog manager written by Radek Doulik and source
-code of the main application.
-
-slang - stripped down S-Lang library.
-
-It's provided to allow compilation that don't have the S-Lang library
-with complete headers or the library is broken.  Please avoid changing
-this code.  If you do change it, please consider contributing your
-changes to the maintainers of S-Lang.
-
-
-Code structure - details
-========================
-
-GNU Midnight Commander uses extensively the dialog manager written by
-Radek Doulik.  To understand how the dialog manager works, please read
-the dialog.c.  You will find the basic widgets in the files widget.c. 
-Some more high-level functions, e.g. to display a message box, are
-located in wtools.c.  This file also contains the Quick Dialog code,
-which makes it easier to create complex dialogs.
-
-Files findme.c, popt.c, poptconfig.c, popthelp.c and poptparse.c come
-from the popt library used to parse the command line.  They should not
-be modified unless absolutely necessary.
-
-The files util.c and utilunix.c have a lot of utility functions.  Get
-familiar with them, they are very simple. 
-
-glib is used for memory allocation and for some utility functions, such
-as manipulation with lists and trees.  gmodule (part of the glib
-distribution) is used to load some libraries dynamically at the run
-time.
-
-Thanks to glib, the code has almost no hardcoded limits, since there are
-many ways to avoid them.  For example, when you want to concatenate
-strings, use the g_strconcat() function:
-
-	new_text = g_strconcat (username, " ", password, (char *)0);
-
-This allocates new memory for the string, so you should use g_free() on
-the result.
-
-The parent of all dialogs is called midnight_dlg.  Both panels are
-widgets in that dialog.  Other widgets include the menu, the command
-line and the button bar.
-
-
-Input handling
-==============
-
-The routines for input handling on the Midnight Commander are:
-getch, get_key_code, mi_getch and get_event.
-
-getch is an interface to the low level system input mechanism.  It
-does not deal with the mouse.  
-
-    In the case of ncurses, this is a function implemented in the
-    ncurses library that translates key sequences to key codes (\E[A to
-    something like KEY_UP and so on).
-
-    In the case of S-Lang there is no such conversion, that's why we
-    load a set of extra definitions.
-
-The get_key_code routine converts the data from getch to the
-constants the Midnight Commander uses.
-
-    In the case of S-Lang, it will actually do all the jobs that getch
-    does for curses.  In the case of curses it patches a couple of
-    sequences that are not available on some terminal databases.  This
-    routine is the one you want to use if you want a character without
-    the mouse support.
-
-get_event is the routine you want to use if you want to handle mouse
-events, it will return 0 on a mouse event, -1 if no input is available
-or a key code if there is some input available.  This routine in turn
-uses get_key_code to decode the input stream and convert it to useful
-constants.
-
-mi_getch is just a wrapper around get_event that ignores all the mouse
-events.  It's used only in a couple of places, this routine may return
--1 if no input is available (if you have set the nodelay option of
-ncurses or S-Lang with nodelay) or a character code if no such option is
-available. 
-
-
-Mouse support
-=============
-
-The mouse support in the Midnight Commander is based on the get_event
-routine.  The core of the mouse event dispatching is in the
-dlg.c:run_dlg routine.
-
-
-ncurses
-=======
-
-Although S-Lang is now used by default, we still support ncurses.  We
-basically are using a small subset of ncurses because we want to be
-compatible with Slang.
-
-
-The Dialog manager and the Widgets
-==================================
-
-The Dialog manager and the Widget structure are implemented in
-src/dialog.c.  Everything shown on screen is a dialog.  Dialogs contain
-widgets, but not everything on screen is a widget.  Dialogs can draw
-themselves.
-
-Dialogs are connected into a singly linked list using "parent" field. 
-Currently active dialog is saved in current_dlg variable.  The toplevel
-dialog has parent NULL.  Usually it's midnight_dlg.
-
-            parent                  parent
-current_dlg ------->another dialog-- ... -->midnight_dlg
-
-When the screen needs to be refreshed, every dialog asks its parent to
-refresh first, and then refreshes itself.
-
-A dialog is created by create_dlg().  Then it's populated by widgets
-using add_widget().  Then the dialog is run by calling run_dlg(), which
-returns the id of the button selected by the user.  Finally, the dialog
-is destroyed by calling destroy_dlg().
-
-Widgets are placed to a doubly linked circular list.  Each widget has
-previous and next widget.
-
-        prev   next         prev   next
-widget1 <---------> widget2 <---------> widget3
-   ^                                       ^
-   -----------------------------------------
-   next                                 prev
-
-Pressing Tab moves focus to the "next" widget, pressing Shift-Tab moves
-focus to "prev".  The tab order is equal to the add order except some
-old code that use the reverse order by setting DLG_REVERSE flag in
-create_dlg() call.  Please don't use reverse order in the new code.
-
-The initial widget to get focus can be selected by calling
-dlg_select_widget().
-
-When creating a dialog, you may want to use a callback that would
-intercept some dialog events.  However, many widgets will do the right
-thing by default, so some dialogs can work just fine without callbacks.
-
-There are also widget events, which are sent by the dialog to individual
-widgets.  Some widgets also have user callbacks.
-
-To create your own widget, use init_widget().  In this case, you must
-provide a callback function.  Please note that it's not the same as the
-user callback in some widgets.

-Programming Tips
-================
-
-(This list should be sorted alphabetically.)
-
-?: This operator has a precedence that is easy to use the wrong way. You
-	might think that
-
-		int right = 25 + have_frame() ? 1 : 0; /* WRONG */
-
-	results in either 25 or 26. This is not the case. The C compiler
-	sees this as:
-
-		int right = (25 + have_frame()) ? 1 : 0; /* WRONG */
-
-	To avoid this, put the ?: in parentheses, like this
-
-		int right = 25 + (have_frame() ? 1 : 0); /* RIGHT */
-
-	If the condition is more complicated, put it in additional
-	parentheses:
-
-		int right = 25 + ((have_frame()) ? 1 : 0); /* RIGHT */
-
-const: For every function taking a string argument, decide whether you
-	(as a user of the function) would expect that the string is modi-
-	fied by the function. If not, declare the string argument as
-	"const char *". If your implementation needs to modify the string,
-	use g_strdup to create a local copy.
-
-const_cast: Has been replaced by str_unconst.
-
-g_free: g_free handles NULL argument too, no need for the comparison.
-	Bad way:
-	    if (old_dir) g_free (old_dir);
-	Right way:
-	    g_free (old_dir);
-
-g_strdup: When you use g_strdup to create a local copy of a string, use
-	the following pattern to keep the reference.
-
-	char * const pathref = g_strdup(argument);
-	/* ... */
-	g_free (pathref);
-
-	The "const" will make the pointer unmodifiable (pathref++
-	is not possible), but you can still modify the string contents.
-	
-g_strlcpy: Whenever you use this function, be sure to add "glibcompat.h"
-	to the included headers. This is because in glib-1.2 there is
-	no such function.
-
-NULL: When you pass NULL as an argument of a varargs function, cast the
-	0 to the appropriate data type. If a system #defines NULL to
-	be 0 (at least NetBSD and OpenBSD do), and the sizes of int and
-	a pointer are different, the argument will be passed as int 0,
-	not as a pointer.
-
-	This tip applies at least to catstrs (edit/edit.h), execl(3),
-	execle(3), execlp(3), g_strconcat (glib), parent_call
-	(src/background.h), parent_call_string (src/background.h),
-	rpc_get (vfs/mcfsutil.h), rpc_send (vfs/mcfsutil.h).
-
-	example:
-	char *path = g_strconcat("dir", "/", "file", (char *)0);
-
-size_t: This data type is suitable for expressing sizes of memory or the
-	length of strings. This type is unsigned, so you need not check
-	if the value is >= 0.
-
-strncpy: Don't use this function in newly created code. It is slow, insecure
-	and hard to use. A much better alternative is g_strlcpy (see there).
-
-str_unconst: We use many libraries that do not know about "const char *"
-	and thus declare their functions to require "char *". If you
-	know for sure that an external function does not modify the
-	string, you can "unconst" a string using the function
-	str_unconst(). If you are not sure whether the function modifies
-	the string, you should use g_strdup() to pass a copy of a string
-	to the function. Don't forget to call g_free() after work is done.
-
-unused: Unused arguments of a function can be marked like this:
-
-	void do_nothing(int data)
-	{
-	    (void) &data;
-	}
-
-	This tells the GNU C Compiler not to emit a warning, and has no
-	side effects for other compilers.

-Installation instructions for GNU Midnight Commander
-----------------------------------------------------
-
-The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and creates
-the makefiles.  It also creates a file `config.status' that you can run
-in the future to recreate the current configuration.
-
-To compile this package:
-
-1.  Configure the package for your system.
-
-Normally, you just `cd' to the directory containing the package's source
-code and type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old version of
-SystemV, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to prevent `csh'
-from trying to execute `configure' itself.  Under AIX, you may need to
-use ksh instead of sh.
-
-Running `configure' takes a while.  While it is running, it prints some
-messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to see any
-messages, run `configure' with the `--quiet' option.
-
-To compile the package in a different directory than the one containing
-the source code, you must use a version of `make' supporting the `VPATH'
-variable, such as GNU `make'.  Change to the directory where you want
-the object files and executables to go and run the `configure' script
-with the full path.  If for some reason `configure' cannot find the
-source code directory, run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR',
-where DIR is the directory that contains the source code.
-
-By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
-`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
-option `--prefix=PATH'.
-
-You can specify separate installation prefixes for architecture specific
-files and architecture-independent files.  If you give `configure' the
-option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH as the prefix for
-installing binary programs and libraries.  Data files and documentation
-will still use the regular prefix.  Normally, all files are installed
-using the same prefix.
-
-If compiled on GNU/Linux, Midnight Commander detects if you have the gpm
-library installed.  If you installed the gpm mouse library in a
-non-standard place, you will need to use the --with-gpm-mouse flag with
-the directory base where you installed the gpm package.
-
-`configure' recognizes the following options (the list may be
-incomplete, use `configure --help' to get the full list):
-
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the options to `configure' and exit.
-
-`--quiet'
-`--silent'
-     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.
-
-`--verbose'
-     Print the results of the checks.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
-     script, and exit.
-
-`--without-edit'
-     Configure GNU Midnight Commander to be compiled without the
-     built-in file editor.  The built-in editor is compiled in by
-     default.
-
-`--with-ext2undel'
-     On systems that use the ext2 or ext3 file system and have the
-     libext2fs library available, this option adds support for
-     recovering deleted files (the undel virtual file system). 
-
-`--without-gpm-mouse'
-     Use this flag to disable gpm mouse support (e.g. if you want to
-     use mouse only on X terminals).
-
-`--with-glib12'
-     Force using glib 1.2.x even if glib 2.0.x is present.  Use this
-     flag for testing or if you want to use the binary on systems that
-     don't have glib 2.0.x installed.
-
-`--with-glib-static'
-     Force linking against glib statically.  This option is intended for
-     building binaries for distribution purposes and may not work on
-     some operating systems.
-
-`--with-mmap', `--without-mmap'
-     Force using or not using the mmap function.  It is currently used
-     in the internal viewer.  `--with-mmap' may be useful on some
-     versions of AIX where the `configure' script decides that mmap is
-     broken, but it's actually suitable for the internal viewer.
-
-`--with-subshell[=optional]', `--without-subshell' 
-     The subshell support is by default turned on, you can disable
-     this by using the --without-subshell option.  If you pass the
-     =optional parameter, then the subshell support is turned off by
-     default.  To turn it on, specify the `-U' option to the program.
-
-`--without-x'
-     By default, the Midnight Commander tries to connect to the X Window
-     System events to query the status of the keyboard modifiers, such
-     as Control, Shift and Alt, when invoked in a terminal emulator
-     under X11.  This is necessary (but not always sufficient) to
-     recognize some optional but handy key combinations like Ctrl-Home
-     and Shift-Cursor keys.  Use `--without-x' if the dependency on
-     X11 libraries is not desired.
-
-`--without-vfs'
-     This option disables the Virtual File System switch code in the
-     Midnight Commander and uses the standard file system calls for
-     file access.  If you specify this option, you won't get the
-     transparent access to archives and remote directories.
-
-`--with-mcfs'
-     This option enables mcfs - a non-standard remote filesystem
-     designed specifically for the Midnight Commander.  It also enables
-     a server for that filesystem, mcserv.  Please note that the
-     implementation of mcfs is not optimized for speed.  There may be
-     security issues with mcserv - don't run it if you don't need it.
-
-`--with-samba'
-     This option enables remote VFS over the SMB protocol.  A stripped
-     down version of samba distributed with the sources is compiled and
-     linked with the mc executable.  It is recommended that you install
-     Samba client, since mc uses some files from Samba under certain
-     conditions.  Please visit http://www.samba.org/ to learn more.
-
-`--disable-largefile'
-     This option disables support for large files (2 gigabytes and more)
-     on the systems where file operations use 32-bit offsets by default,
-     but support for 64-bit offsets is available.  May be useful for
-     slow processors and embedded systems.
-
-`--enable-charset'
-     This option adds support for selecting character set of the text in
-     the internal viewer and editor and converting it on the fly.  The
-     implementation of this option is currently incomplete.
-
-`--disable-background'
-     This option disables support for background operations.  Background
-     operations allow to perform some tasks such as copying files in a
-     separate background process.  Any messages from the background
-     process are forwarded to the foreground process.  More advanced
-     dialogs cannot be forwarded yet, so the background process uses the
-     default.  Background code is known to be less stable than the rest
-     of the code, so you may want to disable it at the compile time.
-
-`--disable-netcode'
-     This option disables support for networked virtual filesystems.
-     It's primarily used by developers to make sure that the code would
-     compile and run on operating systems that lack POSIX compatible
-     network support.  But you can use it is you know that you won't be
-     accessing remote filesystems from GNU Midnight Commander.
-
-You may also tell configure which screen library you want to use with
-the Midnight Commander.  The configure script will use S-Lang as
-default, and prefers an already installed S-Lang library over the
-included one, but you can override this by using the following flag
-(please note that since S-Lang is default, it is tested better than
-ncurses):
-
-`--with-screen={slang|mcslang|ncurses}'
-     Choose the library used to manage interaction with the terminal.
-     `slang' means S-Lang library already installed on the system,
-     `mcslang' means S-Lang library included with the sources of
-     GNU Midnight Commander, `ncurses' means ncurses library already
-     installed on the system.  The installed S-Lang library is used
-     by default if found, otherwise the included S-Lang library is
-     used.
-
-`--with-termcap'
-     If the included S-Lang library is used, this option forces it to
-     use the termcap database, as opposed to the default terminfo
-     database.
-
-On systems that require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the package's `configure' script does not know about, you can give
-`configure' initial values for variables by placing them in the command
-line:
-
-./configure CC='gcc -traditional' LIBS=-lposix
-
-Here are the variables that you might want to override when running
-`configure'.
-
- - Variable: CC
-     C compiler program.  The default is `gcc' if found, otherwise `cc'.
-
- - Variable: CFLAGS
-     The default flags used to build the program.
-
- - Variable: INSTALL
-     Program to use to install files.  The default is `install' if you
-     have it, `cp' otherwise.
-
-For these variables, any value given in the command line is added to the
-value that `configure' decides to use:
-
- - Variable: LIBS
-     Libraries to link with, in the form `-lfoo -lbar...'.
-
- - Variable: LDFLAGS
-     Linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
-     nonstandard directory <lib dir>
-
- - Variable: CPPFLAGS
-     C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
-     headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
-
-If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
-you to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
-mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the README so we can
-include them in the next release.
-
-2.  Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-3.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and the
-documentation.  On GNU/Linux the console screen saver is installed as
-well.
-
-4.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
-directory by typing `make clean'.  If you want to clean the source tree
-completely, so that it contains only those files that should be packaged
-in the archive, issue `make distclean'.  If you've run configure in a
-different directory than the source tree, distclean won't remove your
-*.o and linked programs in that directory.
-
-5.  GNU Midnight Commander allows you to stay in the last current
-directory after exiting MC.  This is done with a shell function, the man
-page has more information about this.
-
-The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
-called `autoconf'.  You only need it if you want to regenerate
-`configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

-Notes about GNU Midnight Commander installation
------------------------------------------------
-
-GNU Midnight Commander has been run in the following configurations:
-
-i386-*-linux
-sparc-*-linux
-alpha-*-linux
-powerpc-*-linux
-mips-dec-ultrix4.3
-mips-dec-{open,net}bsd1.0

-mc88110-aviion-dgux5.4
-i386-*-bsdi2
-i386-*-freebsd4.3
-i386-*-openbsd2.9
-
-Midnight Commander is written in a portable manner and uses GNU Autoconf
-for configuration, so it is expected to compile without changes on many
-other operating systems.
-
-You will need an ANSI C Compiler (such as GCC) and glib library to
-compile the source.  GNU Midnight Commander now comes with the S-Lang
-screen manager, a fast screen manager, but you may want to use the
-already installed S-Lang or ncurses library.
-
-If you insist on using ncurses, it's recommended to use ncurses 4.1 and
-above, since the older versions don't support resizing in the xterm
-window.
-
-GNU Midnight Commander comes with the mouse support on xterms and in the
-Linux console.  In order to take advantage of the mouse support on the
-Linux console you will need the gpm mouse server (see the section
-"Obtaining related software" in this file).
-
-Once you get gpm, compile it and install it, then you will have to
-specify the `--with-gpm-mouse' flag to the configure program if you
-installed it in a non-standard directory.  If you installed the gpm
-package under /usr or /usr/local, you don't need to specify this flag;
-configure will find gpm for you.  The support for mice on xterms is
-always compiled in.
-
-We are working on further enhancements to the program, but we're not
-sure which ones must go first.  If you would like to point us in the
-Right Direction we will be glad to hear from you (you could check the
-file TODO included with this distribution for the current projects).
-
-If you happen to find a feature that doesn't do what you expect, please
-write to mc@gnome.org telling as much as you can about the problem
-you're experiencing.  Please don't send personal messages to the
-maintainers.
-
-
-Obtaining related software
---------------------------
-
-glib
-----
-
-The only "hard" dependency of GNU Midnight Commander is glib.  You can
-get glib from
-
-ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/
-
-Note that only versions 1.2.x and 2.0.x are supported.  Newer versions
-may work, but haven't been tested.
-
-Terminal database
------------------
-
-There are many incomplete terminal databases out there, however, a
-complete terminfo is bundled with ncurses.  (It is simple to generate
-the termcap database using the infocmp utility in ncurses).
-
-Some terminfo data are included with the mc distribution (lib/*.ti).
-Particularly linux, xterm and vt100. Use e.g. ''tic linux.ti'' to use
-them.
-
-If you want to run mc on xterm/color_xterm/ansi_xterm (not rxvt), then
-you might read lib/README.xterm for further information.
-
-Screen libraries
-----------------
-
-GNU Midnight Commander can use the included version of S-Lang, but you
-can get the latest version here:
-
-http://www.s-lang.org/
-
-Alternatively, you can use ncurses:
-
-http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html
-
-Mouse support
--------------
-
-The general purpose mouse (gpm) daemon is available from
-
-ftp://arcana.linux.it/pub/gpm/
-
-Compiler
---------
-
-If your C compiler is not powerful enough to compile GNU Midnight
-Commander, you should report is as a bug to the GNU Midnight Commander
-team.  Sometimes there is no solution than upgrading to a modern and
-free compiler - GCC (Compiler Collection):

-Read the INSTALL file for the complete instructions. 
-
-GNU Midnight Commander requires glib.  Currently the 1.2.x and 2.0.x
-series are supported.  You may already have glib installed, but if you
-don't, take it from ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/
-
-GNU Midnight Commander uses the S-Lang screen library by default. It
-tries the S-Lang library installed on the system.  If it's not found,
-the included S-Lang sources are used.  It is also possible to use
-ncurses as the screen library.
-
-1. Configure the package for your system.
-
-Normally, you just `cd' to the package main directory and type
-`./configure'.
-
-The most often needed options to configure are following:
-
-`--prefix=PATH'
-	By default, `make install' will install the package's files
-	in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc. or to `/usr/bin',
-	`/usr/man', etc. depending on the location of an old mc binary.
-	If you have none in your system, default will be `/usr/local'.
-	You can specify an installation prefix other than default by
-	giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.
-
-`--with-screen={slang|mcslang|ncurses}'
-	Choose the library used to manage interaction with the terminal.
-	`slang' means S-Lang library already installed on the system,
-	`mcslang' means S-Lang library included with the sources of
-	GNU Midnight Commander, `ncurses' means ncurses library already
-	installed on the system.  The installed S-Lang library is used
-	by default if found, otherwise the included S-Lang library is
-	used.
-
-You may also want to specify CFLAGS for the compiler, even if it finds
-itself some defaults by typing e.g.
-
-./configure CFLAGS=-O3
-
-2. Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-3. Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
-documentation.  You may need to run this command as root.
-
-If you're on a GNU/Linux system, this will install the `cons.saver'
-utility, which allows the Midnight Commander to save and restore the
-screen contents.  This utility can be installed setuid root, but it's
-only needed on systems where users cannot access /dev/vcsaN, where N is
-the virtual console number, on which the uses is logged on.
-
-If you're making a mc binary distribution for other people and want to
-package the whole installed tree, use `make install DESTDIR=PATH', which
-will make PATH the root for installation.
-
-4. Type `mc' and enjoy!

-     horizontal scrolling,
-     on the fly decompression (and we don't eat unneeded cycles of CPU),
-     allow non gunzip operation.
-
-- Internal move command:
-
-  Now, we don't rely anymore on system commands in /bin, so the
-  program is more robust and is much faster.  Bunches of code come
-  from the GNU fileutils.
-
-- The Tree view and normal views allows wrapped incremental searches of
-  file names.
-
-- Mask rename:
-
-  Now it's possible to do things like rename *.pas in *.bak

-
-- Visual feedback while i-searching files.
-
-- Much more intuitive, you have to use it.
-
-- It's better than aspirin.
-
-- New memory allocation debugger.
-
-  During testing time, we used a powerful memory allocation debugger,
-  so the program will not eat all your memory, and will make a good use of
-  your memory.  
-
-- Now it also runs on hppa-hp-hpux9, hppa-hp-hpux7, m68k-apple-aux and
-  sparc-sun-netbsd1.0.  The best platform to run it is Linux, of course,
-  since that's where most of us develop it.
-
-- Inode sort option.
-
-- Nice progress status indicator.
-
-  We have two of them: a moving dash indicator and a progress bar

-   Performance enhancements, now it's much faster.
-   Works on systems without mmap.
-
-- Mouse Support now also works on xterms.
-   If you run in the Linux console, you will still need the gpm mouse server
-   to use the mouse support, but if you use xterms, then you're lucky 
-   and can use the mouse support when using xterms.
-
-- Help system and man page.
-   Both were updated and has many more hypertext links inside, the
-   help system can also be used with a mouse.
-
-- If running on xterms, now you can see the output of the last program
-  you ran by using the C-o key combination.
-

-Introduction
-------------
-
-GNU Midnight Commander (also referred to as MC) is a user shell with
-text-mode full-screen interface.  It can be run on the OS console,
-in xterm and other terminal emulators.
-
-GNU Midnight Commander allows you to manage files while making most of
-you screen and giving you a clear representation of the filesystem, yet
-it's simple enough to be run over a telnet or ssh session.
-
-GNU Midnight Commander is released under the GNU General Public
-License version 2.0 or any later version.  A copy of the file is
-included with this distribution package.
-
-
-Dependencies
-------------
-
-To compile the GNU Midnight Commander you need to have a copy of the
-glib library version 1.2.x or 2.0.x, available at
-ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/
-
-
-Features
---------
-
-GNU Midnight Commander was conceived as a free clone of John Socha's
-Norton Commander (TM).  It also takes the best from more recent software
-with similar interfaces.  GNU Midnight Commander comes with mouse support
-on xterm and optionally on the Linux console.
-
-Some features are specific to the POSIX environment MC runs on, some are
-familiar to the users of similar software for other operating systems.
-The features include:
-
-	* Built in Virtual File System: manipulate remote file systems
-          through the FTP and SMB protocols or over secure shell, browse
-          contents of tar, ar, rpm, zip, cpio, lha and rar archives just
-	  like local files.
-
-	* Almost all operations work with the virtual file system,
-	  enabling you to do complex tasks, like viewing files in
-	  archives on an FTP server.
-
-	* Mouse support on most terminal emulators for X Window System
-	  as well as on the Linux console.
-
-	* Learn Keys: GNU Midnight Commander may be configured at run
-	  time to support any kind of input keys for a given terminal,
-	  making its operation possible even on most weird terminals.
-
-	* Text and hex editors are available for you to use (hex editor
-	  is a part of the viewer).
-
-	* Hotlist allows you to keep a list of common visited locations,
-	  including remote sites and directories inside archives.
-
-	* Command completion: By pressing Alt-Tab in any place where a
-	  filename or an executable are expected, GNU Midnight Commander
-	  will complete the name for you.  If you press Alt-Tab for the
-	  second time, you get a list box with all possible completions.
-
-	* Subshell support: Run your commands by a real shell
-	  interpreter.  GNU Midnight Commander interacts with bash,
-	  tcsh and zsh to provide you with all of the facilities
-	  available in your preferred shell.
-
-	* Find file command can search for the file contents.
-
-	* Background operations allow you to copy or move files from
-	  any virtual file system while you do other tasks (i.e., you
-	  can do background FTP copies).
-
-	* FTP proxy is supported.
-
-	* Linux file recovery: If you are using Linux, you can recover
-	  deleted files from an ext2 or ext3 partition with the undelete
-	  file system.  This is a low level file recovery function that
-	  can recover files deleted by any program on Linux.
-
-	* External panelization: You can run any arbitrary external
-	  command and GNU Midnight Commander will display the output
-	  generated as a file listing that can be manipulated as a
-	  regular directory.
-
-	* Emacs-like key bindings are used in all widgets.
-
-	* Context dependent actions (open, view, edit) are available.
-
-	* The built-in file viewer, together with the context dependent
-	  actions is used to format man pages on the fly, coloring mail
-	  messages and more.
-
-	* The built-in editor supports syntax highlighting and external
-	  actions, such as spell checking and formatting.
-
-
-Mini-documentation
-------------------
-
-These are hints for the text mode edition:
-
-* Use the F-Keys for invoking the commands in the function key bar.
-  If your terminal doesn't support F-keys, you can use the <ESC digit>
-  sequence to invoke the corresponding F-digit key.
-
-* Tab changes the current panel.
-
-* All input lines have emacs-like key-bindings (command history is
-  accessed through the M-p and M-n keys).
-
-* The panels accept C-n, C-p for browsing the panel (like in Emacs).
-
-* M-Enter copies the currently selected file name to the input line.
-
-* M-Tab completes the current word (or tries to).
-
-* The Virtual File System is a cute addition to the project, you may
-  browse in tar and compressed tar files as well as browsing remote
-  machines with the mcfs file system.
-
-* Please read the manual page.
-
-* Read the file TODO for the current projects.
-
-You can access the whole documentation online with the F1 key,
-although it's not as nice as the groff printed manual page :-)
-
-
-Where to get more information
------------------------------
-
-There is a webpage for GNU Midnight Commander at
-
-http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/
-
-This page also has current information about mailing lists and some
-useful advices how to report bugs.
-
-You can download the latest version of GNU Midnight Commander from
-
-ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mc/
-
-
-Reporting problems
-------------------
-
-There are two mailing lists, mc@gnome.org and mc-devel@gnome.org.  Use
-mc-devel@gnome.org if you are prepared for a more technical discussion
-with the developers of the package, otherwise use mc@gnome.org.
-
-Please don't sent HTML e-mail to either of those mailing lists.
-
-Include the output of "mc --version", the operating system and the
-distribution (if applicable) you are using, the compiler and the
-configure flags used to compile the program (if you know them).
-
-If the program crashed and produced a core dump, please provide a
-stack trace of the program.
-
-You can do this by running gdb like this:
-
-gdb mc core
-(gdb) where

-Midnight Commander for QNX (not QNX Neutrino)
----------------------------------------------
-
-1. Compiling
-2. Running 'mc' under QNX
-3. List of modifications on mc-4.1.33
-4. TODO
-5. Contact information
-
-1. Compiling
-------------
-
-1.1 Make utility
-----------------
-
-Use 'gmake'. (This is the default 'make' under QNX 4.23+). [The old 'qmake'
-cannot handle the makefiles in the mc-source.]
-
-1.2 Configuring
----------------
-
-If you don't have an installed TCP/IP development kit, you have to 'hide'
-the library file 'socket3r.lib' (can be installed by e.g. Watcom C 10.6)
-in /usr/lib or /usr/watcom/10.6/usr/lib, because the existence of this file
-will confuse 'configure': it will erroneously assume you have the complete
-TCP/IP development kit (with headers) and will enable compiling of the
-network-related VFS code (not only tarfs).
-[A patch would be required in the configure-script to check the existence
-of the TCP/IP-related headers also...]
-
-Use '--disable-nls' option, if you don't have the binary utilities of
-GNU 'gettext' package (e.g. 'msgfmt'). ['--with-included-gettext' doesn't
-really work in 4.1.33, there are configuration/compiling problems...]
-
-1.3 Compiler
-------------
-
-It is advised to use Watcom C 10.6+ to compile the source, because older
-compilers (e.g. 9.52) do not support some convenient/required features.
-[e.g. 'ar'-compatible 'wlib',...]
-
-1.4 "No prototype found for '<function>'" warnings
---------------------------------------------------
-
-It is advised to use high warning level (e.g. 'CFLAGS="-w4" ./configure'),
-when compiling the source, because Watcom C uses a special parameter passing
-convention for functions with fixed number of arguments only. So if the
-compiler doesn't see the correct prototype of a function with variable
-number of arguments (like printf()), it will produce a warning about the
-missing prototype, but generates function call code according to the special
-parameter passing convention, not the required CDECL convention (it is used
-by default for functions with variable number of arguments). So the calling
-convention of the function call code and the function code itself will not
-match! So you MUST provide the correct prototype for function with variable
-number of arguments! (Or you can force using the stack-based calling
-convention as a default, if you have the stack-call-conv version of all of the
-required libraries ('<name>3s.lib')...[Watcom C 10.6 required!])
-
-[The latest release version (4.1.33/qnx) is checked against these types of
-missing prototypes...]
-
-1.5 Tested configuration
-------------------------
-
-QNX 4.24
-Watcom C 10.6 (release version, no newer beta patches)
-Photon 1.12
-no TCP/IP development kit (-> VFS: tarfs only!)
-mc-4.1.33, mc-4.1.34
-
-2. Running 'mc' under QNX
--------------------------
-
-Using 'qnx*' terminals:
-
-  You cannot use your keyboard correctly, if you disable the "Full 8 bits
-  input" feature in the 'Options|Display bits...' dialog.
-
-  On 'qnx*' terminals 'mc' will run in black and white mode by default,
-  because these types of terminals use non-ANSI-compatible color sequences.
-
-Accessing remote nodes via the native QNX-network:
-
-  [The problem exists under the older versions of 'mc' only...]
-  If directory panels cannot handle '//<node-id>' prefix in directory names,
-  use directory links in order to access remote nodes on the native QNX
-  network:
-
-        mkdir /net
-        ln -sf //1/ /net/1
-        ...
-
-Extension and menu files:
-
-  Default 'tar' uses 'stderr' (and not 'stdout' as its 'normal' output with
-  '-t' option.
-  
-  Default 'tar' is not a GNU 'tar', so does not understand '-z' option.
-
-Special key-mappings:
-
-  Restrictions of the META-? as Alt-? functionality:
-  [META-? as ESC-? will always work!!!]
-
-    Alt-TAB   -> Ctrl-TAB    (Alt-TAB reserved in Photon [1.12+])
-    Alt-ENTER -> Ctrl-ENTER  ('qnx*' terminals only)
-  
-    Alt-<uppercase letter>: doesn't work
-
-'qansi*' terminals:
-
-  Problem [QNX 4.23+ only]: screen corruption (strange line-drawing character
-  set handling) on 'qansi*' terminals, if linked with mc/Slang/terminfo
-  terminal management. (Older versions of QNX and Slang/termcap not affected.)
-
-  This problem is solved, see the comments in slang/sldisply.c about
-  SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH and QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS!
-
-other terminals:
-
-  I have tested 'mc' under QNX on 'qnx*' and 'qansi*' terminals only. 
-  
-toggle panels on/off (CTRL-o):
-
-  Currently not supported, but could be implemented later...
-
-3. List of modifications on mc-4.1.33/mc-4.1.34
------------------------------------------------
-
-edit/
-
- syntax.c: (4.1.33 only, fixed in 4.1.34)
-
-   line 100,191: WCC 10.6 doesn't like "<label>: }" construct ("no statement
-   after the label"), modified to "<label>: /*nop*/; }".
-
-lib/
-
-  mc.menu:
-
-    'Z' on 'tar.Z' and 'tar.z' files: '%f' -> '$1'.
-
-  mc.ext.in.qnx.diff:
-
-    QNX: modified 'mc.ext.in'. [tar -t: output to stderr,...]
-    
-    (No automatic install implemented: patch must be applied before
-    running 'configure' [->mc.ext.in.qnx.diff!]; this patch can be not
-    only QNX-specific...) 
-
-  Makefile.in:
-
-    'mc.ext.in.qnx.diff' added to DISTLIB.
-
-slang/
-
-  sldisply.c:
-
-    SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH dependent code:
-
-    The problem: some terminals (e.g. QNX/qansi*) map the whole upper half of
-    the ASCII table to the lower half, when alt-char-set is activated with
-    the smacs/as string-sequence. This means, that if 0 <= ch < 128 written
-    to the terminal, it will be translated to (ch+128) automatically by the
-    terminal: so not only the line-drawing characters can be written, when
-    the alt-char-set is activated. It implicitly means, that space, NL, CR,
-    etc. characters (exactly: anything besides the "standard" line drawing
-    characters) cannot be written directly to the terminal, when the
-    alt-char-set is activated, because writing these characters doesn't cause
-    an implicit/temporary switching-back to the standard char-set!
-   
-    The original code in SLang assumes that space, NL, CR, etc. can be
-    printed when alt-char-set is activated. If SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH is
-    defined, the modified code will not use this assumption.
-    [Remark: the patch-code is not the most exact solution, but works...]
-
-    QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS_PATCH dependent code:
-
-    A more OS/terminal-specific solution for the problem mentioned above
-    (->SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH).
-  
-    If QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS is defined, the default smacs/sa, rmacs/ae,
-    acsc/ac [and sgr/sa, if it would be used!] command sequences will be
-    replaced internally with the "old style" (pre-QNX 4.23) sequences in case
-    of QNX/qansi terminals. Using these optional command sequences the terminal
-    remains compatible with the original SLang code (without using the
-    workaround-code enabled by defining SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH).
-   
-    Remark:
-
-    Currently SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH is not auto-configured by 'configure'.
-    (Must be manually defined...)
-
-    There is some (QNX-specific) auto-configuration hand-coded in the source:
-
-        #ifdef SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH
-        # if defined(__QNX__) && defined(QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS)
-        #  undef SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH
-        # endif
-        #else
-        # if defined(__QNX__) && !defined(QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS)
-        #  define QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS 1
-        # endif
-        #endif
-
-  slutty.c:
-
-    "newtty.c_iflag &= ~(ECHO | INLCR | ICRNL);"
-
-    ECHO(0x08) is a c_lflag bit, it means PARMRK(0x08) in c_iflag. (!?!)
-
-src/
-
-  file.c:
-
-    'do_reget' can be extern if (USE_VFS && USE_NETCODE), not if (USE_VFS).
-
-  find.c:
-
-    search_content():
-    
-    variable 'i' "must be" 'int', not 'char'. ["i == -1": (buggy?) WCC 10.6
-    doesn't convert automatically (int)(-1) to (char)(-1) (GCC does), so
-    "comparison result always 0" warning produced. It is cleaner to define
-    'i' as 'int', than cast '-1' to 'char', because 'read()' returns 'int'.]
-    
-  key.c:
-
-    init_key():
-
-    Call load_xtra_key_defines() and clear 'use_8th_bit_as_meta' by default
-    under QNX, if a 'qnx*' terminal detected. (A saved config file (mc.ini)
-    can override it later...)
-
-  key.h:
-
-    Declare load_xtra_key_defines().
-
-  keyxdef.c:
-
-    Provides a method to define some platform-specific additional key
-    mappings. (e.g. QNX terminals can handle most of META-? combinations as
-    ALT-?...)
-    
-    (Currently not listed in doc/FILES...)
-
-  layout.c:
-
-    TIOCGWINSZ must be available (<sys/ioctl.h> included), because window-
-    resizing code doesn't work, if not defined.
-
-  main.c:
-
-    print_usage(): reserved name in the QNX run-time library!
-    print_usage() -> print_mc_usage()
-
-  mouse.c:
-
-    QNX: ncurses 1.9.8a ported to QNX doesn't provide the 'SP' pointer as a
-    global symbol in the library, so the keyok() emulation currently cannot
-    be used under QNX (4.24 & Watcom C 10.6 release version).
-
-  slint.c:
-
-    QNX: 'qansi*' terminals added to the color_terminals[] list.
-    
-  subshell.c:
-  utilunix.c:
-
-    QNX: include <unix.h> to get prototype for exec*()!!!
-    [See README.QNX/Section 1.4!]
-    
-  Makefile.in:
-
-    'keyxdef' module added to SRCS and OBJS.
-
-vfs/
-
-  Makefile.in:
-
-    'install' target: 'mcserv' not installed, if net-code not enabled
-    by 'configure'.
-
-<mc-src-root>/
-
-  README.QNX:
-
-    QNX-specific notes...
-  
-  configure (line 3369):
-  configure.in (line 88):
-
-    (mc-4.1.34 only)
-    'test x$CCOPTS = x;' => 'test "x$CCOPTS" = x;'
-
-  Makefile.in:
-
-    README.QNX added to DISTMAIN.
-    
-4. TODO
--------
-
-Because of limited time and resources now I can define a 'wish list' only:
-(maybe somebody in the QNX community can help...)
-
-subshell support with panel switch on/off ?
-mouse under Photon (with qnxm, qansi-m terminals) ?
-...
-
-5. Contact information
-----------------------
-
-Please report QNX-specific bugs and comments via e-mail to: gt_cosy@usa.net

-mc manual: Add Environment Variables section
-
-Check all instances of const_cast and str_unconst, remove the
-unnecessary and comment the rest.
-
-Clean up #include's in all files.
-
-Make mc work with 64 bit data types. This includes support for 64 bit
-processors, 64 bit operating systems and 64 bit file sizes. Generalizing
-this, mc should use datatypes as they are appropriate.
-
-Remove all instances of type casts on function pointers. Run the
-following command to get a list of function pointer types.
-    grep -r 'typedef.*(\*' . \
-    | sed -n 's/.*(\*\([[:alnum:]_]*\)).*/(\1)/p' \
-    | sort -u \

-Then use fgrep to find illegal uses of these types.
-    fgrep -r "`cat fn-types.txt`" .
-Fix these uses by writing small wrapper functions.
-
-When saving a file is not possible, mcedit should ask the user what to
-do:
-- su(1) to another user and try again
-- sudo
-- change permissions of the file or the containg directory
-- other smart things
-
-Due to problems in the VFS, files are not written back after being edited
-over VFS with an external editor.
-
-Allow pathnames starting with spaces in vfs/extfs.
-
-Hide the passwords when displaying mcvfs path names.
-
-Broken pipe warning when viewing large *.tar.gz files.  Warnings should
-be shown before the viewer is started if possible.
-
-Cannot spell check unsaved files in the editor.
-
-Dynamic loading for libgpm, libext2fs.
-
-Check if the archive was changed for extfs, tar and cpio.  Free the data
-associated with the old archive.
-
-Use Del to remove items from history.
-
-Ctrl-q Ctrl-m in input dialog should enter \r, not a newline.
-
-Interpret C literals in regular expressions entered by the user, e.g. \r
-and \0x0D.
-
-Allow entering archives in VFS by Ctrl-PgDown with non-empty command
-line.  Right now, there is no convenient way to enter an archive when
-the command line is not empty.
-
-Allow switching between histories of two panels.  It's convenient to
-change to a directory from the history of the other panel.
-
-Allow calling the directory hotlist from Copy, Move and Find File
-dialogs.  Recent directories are the obvious candidates for copying and
-looking for files.
-
-Allow modifiers for keys in mc.lib, like "shift-up".  Right now,
-modifiers can be read from the terminal (if supported), but not from the
-config file.  This change would make it possible to use modifiers even
-if they can only be identified by the escape sequences.
-
-When saving config files, write to a copy, then replace the file.  This
-would avoid the problem of partly written config files.  Consider using
-locking of the config files.
-
-Totals are not calculated when copying or moving a single directory. 
-Totals should only be omitted for single files.
-
-Recheck all mouse handlers, make sure that they check button number.  We
-don't want mouse scrolling to be interpreted as mouse click.
-
-Smooth mouse scrolling on panels.  Scrolling one page per step is too
-fast.
-
-Don't read prompt from the subshell, because it's unreliable.  Interpret
-environment variable MC_PS1 (or PS1) in the same way as bash.
-
-Support an environment variable (also like PS1 in bash) for setting the
-window title.
-
-real_input_dialog_help() shouldn't use translated strings in the section
-names in .mc/history.  Right now, mc writes separate history sections
-for different locales.  Only input history is affected.
-
-Add "Ignore" and "Ignore all" buttons when reporting permission
-problems.
-
-Better date parser - don't allow seconds and year in ftp listings on the
-same line.
-
-Report errors in fish operations and recover from them.
-
-Allow colors to be defined in the mc.lib file.  Make it possible to
-avoid using a super-long line to redefine all colors.
-
-Allow verbatim search in "Find File".  Right now, the context is always
-interpreted as regular expression.
-
-Filters in the editor should operate on the open file - don't close and
-reopen the file.  They don't work on VFS now.  For example, a gzipped
-files on FTP cannot be edited.
-
-ftp and fish with home != '/' - readjust directory to the home.
-
-Search in the viewer should have an option for case sensitive search.
-
-Make "Find File" dialog more responsive.  Keep state in a structure and
-preserve it when the search is suspended.
-
-Use KDGKBENT ioctl on Linux console to find the mapping for shifted
-functional keys.  Two mappings are widely used (Shift-F1 = F11 and
-Shift-F1 = F13).  mc should adjust the keys to the mapping.
-
-Alt-O should optionally show the current directory and move cursor down
-(as in older versions).  Old functionality on files (go to "..") is not
-needed.
-
-
-After 4.6.2 on 4.6.x branch
-===========================
-
-Make the internal editor reentrant.  Add "edit menu file" to the editor
-menu.
-
-Safe and restore file position in the viewer.
-
-Consistent support for mc.lib.
-
-Consistent support for terminal-specific settings.
-
-New syntax for mc.ext - path check, desktop environment check.  Detach X
-programs into a separate process group.  Allow forcing the full path on
-local files.
-
-Click on an image doesn't always work on remote vfs - local copy may
-be deleted before the application has time to load it.
-
-Allow running executables from remote VFS.  Possibly warn the user.
-
-Add print dialog in the internal editor.
-
-Implement logging, not just for VFS.
-
-"Find file" should remember full starting path, not "." in the history.
-
-
-In the 4.7 branch
-=================
-
-Eliminate all pipes in subshell.c, run pwd after kill.  Add support for
-more shells (e.g. ksh).
-
-Internal terminal - no more console saving.
-
-Implement a really Advanced Chown/Chmod.
-
-Support for multi-byte charsets (e.g. UTF-8).
-
-sftp and fxp support in VFS.
-
-New listing mode keyword "time": mtime or the time (atime, ctime) used
-to sort files.
-
-Support for X clipboard.
-
-Provide "patch" and "diff" editors. The patch editor will automatically
-adjust the line numbers of the following chunks when lines are deleted
-or inserted at the beginning of the file.
-
-Provide context menus for files. Possible actions include: [compile],
-[CVS commit], [CVS diff -up], [pack], [unpack], [grep].
-
-Make mc a CVS frontend comparable to Eclipse-3.0.
-
-More standard Widgets: WTreeView, WDirectoryList, WGroupBox, WTextArea,
-WOpenDialog, WSaveDialog, WPrintDialog, WKeyBar.
-
-========================================================================
-Everything below this point is the old TODO list.  It doesn't reflect
-the current priorities of the developers, but may contain interesting
-ideas still waiting for their implementation.
-========================================================================
-
-
-* Bugs
-
-  - "Files" message flickers a lot when copying files.
-
-  - Make the extfs handle re-reads.
-
-  - Document (or remove) C-x C-r, C-x C-s.
-
-  - Check that all the help contexts exist on the help file.
-
-  - Make the buttonbar for the tree box work.
-
-  - In the incremental search mode, when backspacing, select the
-    correct file, do not stop in current file.
-
-  - Make C-y yank back all the killed text at once if you've just done
-    several kill operations in a row (C-k, M-d, etc).
-
-  - In learn keys, warn the user if he is trying to
-    i) define a same sequence as an already defined (if the keycode differs)
-    ii) define a sequence, which is a prefix of other longer and already
-        defined sequence
-
-* Configuration 
-
-* Documentation
-
-  - Convert the source mc.1 to mc.sgml and create automagically from it
-    mc.1, mc.html, mc.hlp, mc.info, mc.tex, mc.txt etc.
-
-* Extensions
-
-   - Hotlist should allow people to edit the entry (like we do in the external
-     panelize thing).
-
-   - Change ext.c to allow the %{..} to recursively expand any other %thingies.
-
-   - Write a general grow_string routine.  This code is used in the internal
-     viewer and would also be used in the profile.c code.
-
-   -  A command to set the line length to a fixed value for viewing
-      fixed length binary files. LIST does this with Ctrl-B and then
-      prompts for a "record" length.
-
-   - Viewer: Mark all found matches, and when 'n' is pressed go to the
-     next page, not the next match on the same screen (when there is
-     more than one).
-
-  - In ftpfs_open, extfs_open, if we set local_filename to tmpnam, use
-    a mechanism to set local_filename to another place on the local
-    diskspace (this would be useful for copying, so that we would save
-    some tmp space). This would require special care in file.c afterwards.
-
-  - In Listing mode... give at least three user-definable formats
-    (using Janne's Listing mode editor) and assign hot-keys to both
-    standard and user defined (what about c-x f [fbl123] ?).
-
-  - Shift-Home, Shift-End for the input line: home and end.
-
-  - Make a mechanism to lock all the mouse events and send them to
-    the locking widget until unlocking is done.
-
-  - Sort with numerical extensions.
-
-  - Allow the program to execute a command even when we are on a vfs, maybe
-    a special box, or make subshell code ignore the change directory
-    request. Perhaps each vfs should store a local path attached to it,
-    like in tarfs, extfs it would be the directory which contains the
-    topmost tararchive, in ftpfs it would be the directory which we entered
-    to ftp from.
-
-  - auto_hint_lines: a variable that would choose to use hint mode when
-    at least auto_hint_lines are visible.
-
-  - Listbox: Mouse handler for the scrollbar: this will be hard with
-    the current approach (since the listbox scrollbar is drawn *outside*
-    the listbox control area).
-
-  - In file.c, we shouldn't need to get a full path name in order to
-    work, we should instead canon the file name inside the tar.c (the
-    only fs that relies on this), tar.c should know about the cwd (i
-    think).
-
-  - Panelize the selected files.
-
-  - Recursive delete should (perhaps as an option) delete files just after
-    they have been copied and not to delay deleting until everything was
-    moved.
-
-  - When copying a tree (or moving or deleting), as an option act primarily
-    on the regular files and at the end on directories recursively, so that
-    we get complete high parts of the tree if something fails (useful for
-    ftpfs).
-
-  - Put into a new and bigger Options/Configuration dialog all the options
-    we have now to set using .mc/ini manually.
-
-  - When after deleting there are no files in a panelized panel, restore
-    it automagically to the real directory content.
-
-  - Files/Symlink and Link should be able to do multiple links (if the
-    target is a directory).
-
-  - Directory sizes should work in background using try_channels.
-
-  - Support of non-UNIX ls in ftpfs. Perhaps using an ascii configuration
-    file similar to moxftp.
-
-  - Have an option to let the user choose the preferred keybindings.
-    Currently, only the emacs keybindings are supported, add support
-    for Norton Commander and vi keybindings.
-
-  - Find command should have a way to specify directories to skip.
-
-  - Add an option that will let listboxes do incremental searches.
-
-* Optimizations and cleanup
-
-  - Optimize the mcfs read and write code: make the code output 8k
-    blocks all the time (if we have called mc_hint_readall) and probe
-    the input for a possible cancel.
-
-  - When verbose is off, remove all the clutter on the screen about
-    the files being copied.
-
-  - The viewer is calling view_update in many places, I call
-    view_update after handling a key, should all the other
-    view_updates be removed?
-
-  - If the viewer is too slow, some caching could be done.
-    width and cols are currently computed each time they are needed.
-
- ++ In the user menu, don't use the entries array, we can now grow
-    dynamically.  I should take a look at this one day, it's easy to
-    fix.

+%changelog
+* Fri Jun 22 2007 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Make cons.saver suid vcsa, it's needed for Fedora 7
+
+* Thu Dec 21 2006 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Don't rely on brace expansion, it may be disabled
+
+* Mon Jan 30 2006 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Avoid using %{_prefix} where more specialized macros are available.
+
+* Tue Aug 02 2005 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Replace obsolete "Copyright" with "License".
+
+* Thu Mar 31 2005 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Comment out build dependencies - they are too distribution specific.
+
+* Tue Sep 23 2003 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Remove term directory, it's obsolete and irrelevant on modern systems.
+- Include translated menu files.
+
+* Sun Feb 16 2003 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Remove obsolete dependency on /sbin/chkconfig.
+
+* Tue Dec 24 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Work around bug in rpm 4.1 that expands defines in comments.
+- Handle --without-x.
+
+* Mon Nov 04 2002 Andrew V. Samoilov <sav@bcs.zp.ua>
+- Handle --with ext2undel.
+
+* Fri Nov 01 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Add wrappers to support setting last directory on exit.  Keep all
+  scripts in their original directory, just copy them.
+
+* Tue Oct 22 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Don't use the included S-Lang, there is a workaround for Red Hat 8.0
+  S-Lang, and binary compatibility with Red Hat 7.x doesn't work anyway.
+
+* Tue Oct 08 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Use the included S-Lang again, since we include a better version now.
+  This should avoid incompatibility with Red Hat 7.x.
+- Add _with_glib2 option.
+
+* Mon Oct 07 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Remove installed mc.sh and mc.csh from %{_prefix}/share/mc/bin to
+  suppress a warning about installed but unpackaged files.
+
+* Mon Sep 30 2002 Andrew V. Samoilov <sav@bcs.zp.ua>
+- Don't require slang-devel if _with_ncurses.
+- Handle --with samba.
+
+* Sun Sep 29 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Use --with-screen instead of --with-ncurses and --with-included-slang.
+
+* Mon Sep 23 2002 Andrew V. Samoilov <sav@bcs.zp.ua>
+- Restore %config for %{_prefix}/share/mc/mc.charsets.

+
+* Sat Sep 21 2002 Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
+- Use FHS-compliant paths.

+
+1 Getting started
+
+1.1 What is Midnight Commander?
+
+   GNU Midnight Commander is a user-friendly yet powerful file manager
+   and visual shell, useful to novice and guru alike.  It provides a
+   clear, user-friendly, and somewhat protected interface to a Unix
+   system while making many frequent file operations more efficient and
+   preserving the full power of the command prompt.  After some
+   practice, you will wonder how you could ever live without it.
+
+1.2 Does it run on my machine?
+
+   GNU Midnight Commander runs on POSIX (Unix-like) operating systems,
+   such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, HP-UX and others.  It
+   can also be compiled under Cygwin on Windows.
+
+   GNU Midnight Commander uses GNU Autoconf which should automatically
+   configure it for every Unix clone.  Following configurations have
+   been tested in the past (this list is very old):
+
+     * i386-*-linux1.x, 2.x
+     * alpha-linux-linux2
+     * sparc-linux-linux2.x
+     * sparc64-linux-linux2.1
+     * mips-sgi-irix5.x, 6.x
+     * mips-dec-ultrix4.3
+     * rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5
+     * sparc-sun-sunos4.1
+     * sparc-sun-solaris2.3, 2.4, 2.5
+     * sparc-sun-netbsd1.0
+     * hppa-hp-hpux9
+     * hppa-hp-hpux7
+     * m68k-apple-aux
+     * unixware
+     * mc88110-aviion-dgux5.4R2.01
+     * i386-*-sco3.2v4.2
+     * i386-*-sco3.2v5
+
+1.3 Does it work with my terminal?
+
+   Yes, it does.
+
+   Because GNU Midnight Commander is a full screen program it doesn't
+   run on dummy terminals but anything more advanced will do (like
+   vt100).  If your terminal works with vi, emacs, elm or pine it will
+   work with GNU Midnight Commander.
+
+1.4 What else do I need to run MC?
+
+   You need a POSIX (Unix compatible) operating system.  If you are
+   running Windows, use Cygwin.
+
+   To compile any edition you need to have glib 1.2.x or newer
+   installed.  It's available at ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/.  If you
+   don't have glib installed already, please note that glib 2.x is much
+   harder to compile, so your first choice should be glib 1.2.10.
+
+   If you want to use mouse on the Linux console you need the gpm daemon
+   from ftp://ftp.systemy.it/pub/develop/.  You need nothing extra to
+   use mouse on xterm.
+
+   If you do not want to use the S-Lang library you could try using
+   ncurses version 4.1 and above.
+
+1.5 Is GNU Midnight Commander Public Domain? Copyrighted?
+
+   Midnight Commander is under GNU Public License which basically means
+   that you may freely copy, change and distribute it, but that you may
+   not impose any restrictions on further distribution, and that you
+   must make the source code available.  This is not the same as Public
+   Domain.  For details, the GNU license is included in GNU Midnight
+   Commander source distribution (the COPYING file).
+
+   Midnight Commander is now officially a part of the GNU project.
+   All the authors of GNU Midnight Commander have given all their rights
+   on the program to the Free Software Foundation.
+
+1.6 Where can I get GNU Midnight Commander?
+
+   The main site is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/mc/
+
+1.7 I don't have FTP access.  Where can I get MC?
+
+   Most GNU/Linux distributions include GNU Midnight Commander.  For
+   example, Debian, Mandrake, Red Hat, Slackware and SuSE.
+
+1.8 I cannot compile MC.  What should I do?
+
+   Make sure you have read the INSTALL file in the sources.  Report the
+   error messages exactly as they appear, mention the versions of your
+   OS, your compiler and whatever else software you think is relevant.
+   If you have compile problems in the VFS code, try disabling it by
+   using "--without-vfs" switch.  As the last resort, you can use
+   precompiled binaries from the GNU Midnight Commander website.
+
+
+2 Keyboard
+
+2.1 What does documentation mean with the C-?, M-? and F? keys?
+
+   GNU Midnight Commander documentation uses emacs style names for
+   keyboard keys.
+
+   C stands for the Ctrl key.  For example, C-f means that you should
+   hold down the Ctrl key and press the f key.
+
+   M stands for the Meta key.  Your terminal might call it Alt or
+   Compose instead of Meta.  For example, M-f means that you should hold
+   down the Meta/Alt/Compose key and press the f key.  If your terminal
+   doesn't have Meta, Alt or Compose or they don't work you can use Esc.
+   For M-f press the Esc key and then press the f key.
+
+   Sometimes Ctrl and Alt are used instead of C and M for simplicity.
+   Keep in mind that Alt can actually be Meta on some keyboards.
+
+   F? stands for a function key.  If your terminal doesn't have function
+   keys or they don't work you can use Esc.  For example, for F3 press
+   the Esc key and then press the 3 key.
+
+2.2 Why don't function keys (or some other key) work?
+
+   Your terminfo or termcap database has missing or incorrect
+   definitions for function keys.  Type "mc -V" to see what terminal
+   database is being used.  If the result is "using the S-Lang library
+   with terminfo database" and you are using a very old terminfo
+   database, consider installing one of the enhanced terminfo files
+   included in GNU Midnight Commander source distribution.  For example,
+   if you are using xterm type "tic xterm.ti".
+
+   If the result is "using the S-Lang library with termcap database" you
+   should fix your /etc/termcap database.
+
+   Up-to-date termcap and terminfo databases are available here:
+
+     http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/terminfo/
+     ftp://dickey.his.com/ncurses/
+
+   You can force Midnight Commander to use the termcap database by
+   giving --with-termcap option to the configure script.  The default
+   is to use terminfo.
+
+   If you don't have permissions to edit terminal databases you can use
+   Learn keys feature of Midnight Commander instead.  Press Esc 9 o k
+   and follow instructions.
+
+   If all else fails you can emulate function keys by first pressing the
+   ESC key and then one of the number keys.  For example, if you want to
+   produce F9, press ESC, then 9.  If you don't have a ESC key on your
+   keyboard you can try alt-9 or meta-9.
+
+2.3 How do I use function keys F11 to F20?
+
+   These are normally mapped to function keys F1 to F10 with Shift held,
+   e.g. function key F13 can be activated by pressing Shift-F3.  You can
+   define the keys this way in the Options->Learn Keys dialog.  The
+   convention for PC keyboards is that F11-20 always means Shift with
+   F1-10.
+
+   You may find that on the Linux console with some keyboard layouts
+   Shift-Fn is interpreted as F(n+12), not as F(n+10).  This is a result
+   of non-uniformity of keyboard layouts.  This is not an intended
+   behavior and it may be fixed some day.  In the meantime, use "Learn
+   Keys" to remedy this inconvenience.
+
+2.4 Why does the ESC key behave funny?
+
+   Midnight Commander uses the ESC key as a prefix for simulating the
+   Meta and Alt keys (for terminals which don't have Meta or Alt, see
+   the three previous questions).  For example, pressing ESC-a is the
+   same as pressing Meta-a.  In addition most terminals use ESC for
+   internal representation of arrow keys, function keys and other
+   enhanced keys.  If you want to use ESC to cancel things you have to
+   press it twice i.e. ESC-ESC.  If you find this cumbersome you can
+   generally use F10 to cancel.  Alternatively turn on the old_esc_mode
+   setting in the ~/.mc/ini file.  The old_esc_mode setting makes ESC
+   work as a prefix only if another key is pressed within 0.5 seconds.
+   After 0.5 seconds the ESC key cancels.  There is no way to make ESC
+   cancel immediately (if we want to be able to use arrows keys and
+   function keys).
+
+2.5 How can I add the plus sign (+) on the command line?
+
+   Press C-q first, then press the + sign.
+
+   The plus key is the hotkey for the select files command.  If you want
+   to add a literal plus on to the command line you must quote it by
+   pressing C-q first.
+
+   Another common key which needs the C-q prefix is backslash "\".
+
+2.6 C-o doesn't work!
+
+   Maybe C-o is a stty control character on your terminal.  See man stty
+   for details on how to list and change stty control characters.
+
+2.7 What 'keys' are the "a1" and "c1" keys mentioned in the manual?
+
+   The "a1" key is the key which has the "a1" caption on it.
+
+   The "c1" key is the key which has the "c1" caption on it.
+
+   If you have to ask what these two keys are your keyboard hasn't
+   probably got them.  Actually, I have never seen a keyboard which has
+   got them.
+
+2.8 How do I change the key bindings?
+
+   There is no generic way to reconfigure the key bindings.  You can use
+   the "Learn Keys" dialog to assign keys to some actions listed in that
+   dialog.  However, most actions cannot be redefined to use different
+   keys.
+
+
+3 Mouse
+
+3.1 How do I enable mouse support?
+
+   Invoke mc like this (without quotes): "mc -x".  If this doesn't work
+   upgrade to a terminal which compatible with the Xterm mouse
+   sequences.
+
+   Alternatively, on Linux console you can use gpm.
+
+3.2 How do I cut and paste text with mouse?
+
+   Hold down shift key while using mouse to cut and paste.
+
+3.3 How do I get the extension dependent pop-up menu to pop up?
+
+   It was developed for the GNOME edition.  The text-mode edition
+   doesn't support this feature yet.
+
+
+4 Display
+
+4.1 Why do I keep getting "Terminal not powerful enough for SLang" or
+    "Terminal not powerful enough for SLsmg"?
+
+   This means that your terminfo databases do not contain the correct
+   definitions for your terminal.
+
+   You could try using a different terminal setting.  If you use csh or
+   tcsh:
+
+     setenv TERM vt100
+
+   or if you use sh, bash, ksh or zsh:
+
+     export TERM=vt100
+
+   If this doesn't help you can recompile MC to use termcap instead of
+   terminfo:
+
+     ./configure --with-termcap
+     make
+
+4.2 Why don't line drawing characters work?
+
+   Since version 4.0.13 there's the command line option -a to force use
+   of charaters +, |, - for line drawing (only available when compiled
+   with S-Lang).  Use the -a option if any of the suggestions below
+   doesn't help.
+
+   In general, there are three cases:
+     * Lines are shown as ASCII characters like this
+
+      +---------+
+      |         |
+      +---------+
+
+       This also happens when you use the -a option.  Other than that
+       possible reason is 1 or 2 (see below).
+
+     * Lines are shown as lower case characters like this
+
+      lqqqqqqqqqk
+      x         x
+      mqqqqqqqqqj
+
+       Possible reason is 1 or 2 (see below).
+
+     * Lines are shown as blanks or missing characters.  Possible reason
+       is 2 or 3 (see below).
+
+   The reason for the problem is one of following:
+
+    1. Your terminal might not support line drawing characters.  VT100
+       compatible terminals, rxvt and xterm and color_xterm do support
+       them.
+    2. Your terminfo or termcap database might have missing or incorrect
+       definitions for line drawing characters.  Set the acsc variable
+       in the terminfo database like this:
+       acsc=a\376k\277l\332m\300j\331n\305w\302v\301u\264t\303q\304x
+       \263h\2600\333
+       Don't forget issue 'tic' command.  This supposes you are using PC
+       character set.  The octal values might be different for other
+       character sets.  If you are using termcap instead of terminfo,
+       you should modify above solution appropriately.
+    3. Your terminal font might not support line drawing characters.
+       Try changing the font.
+
+   Here is Miguel's answer to Torben on this subject.
+
+   Torben:
+
+     When I load consolefonts/iso01.f16, I get perfectly right national
+     characters, but the line drawing characters in mc get wrong.  Is it
+     a mc problem, or is it a problem with the font? (I guess it is).
+
+     Is there a trick?
+
+   Miguel:
+
+     First of all, we should determine whether the font has line drawing
+     characters or not.
+
+     If it has line drawing characters, then a new terminfo entry should
+     be written for this specific case.  Let's call this linux-iso01.
+     The acsc variable should be modified to reflect which characters
+     are used to do the line drawing.
+
+     If it does not have line drawing characters, then we should get rid
+     of the switch to acsc sequences and make the acsc sequence be just
+     a mapping to the ugly +, -, |, - characters.
+
+     You can get your terminfo definition by running the infocmp
+     program, making the proper changes and running the tic program to
+     compile your new terminfo database.
+
+4.3 Can one use latin-1 characters without losing the lines?
+
+   Yes, you need a correct font and a correct termcap/terminfo database.
+
+   For font, if you use xterm try "xterm -fn fixed".
+
+   For termcap/terminfo database, change the acsc capability in the
+   database.
+
+4.4 I have problems with entering/viewing national characters!
+
+   Upgrade to version 4.0.12 or newer.
+
+   From the Options - Display Bits dialog select Full 8 bits or ISO
+   8859-1.  In addition, select 8 bit input from the same dialog.
+
+4.5 How can I get colors?
+
+   Invoke mc like this (without quotes): "mc -c".
+
+   If you get colors, be happy.
+
+   If your terminal stays black and white, your terminal doesn't support
+   color.  You might want to upgrade to a terminal which compatible with
+   the ANSI color sequences.
+
+   If your terminal goes completely black, see the next question.
+
+   More detailed answer:
+
+   Check that your terminal supports color.  color_xterm, rxvt and Linux
+   console do support, most other terminals don't.  You can test color
+   support with following simple C program:
+
+    #include <stdio.h>
+
+    int main (void){
+        printf ("\033[32m Hello world! \033[m\n");
+        return 0;
+    }
+
+   Compile and run it.  If you see "Hello world!" text in green your
+   terminal supports color, otherwise not (however, for color_xterm see
+   also the next question).
+
+   Check whether you are using Ncurses or the S-Lang library (type
+   "mc -V" to find out).
+
+   With S-Lang library you can force color support by setting the
+   environment variable COLORTERM to any value.
+
+   If you use ncurses library, check that your terminfo database
+   supports color.  If not, you should install one of the enhanced
+   terminfo databases included in GNU Midnight Commander source
+   distribution.
+
+   You might want to set the TERM environment variable so that you are
+   using the correct terminfo database or termcap entry.
+
+   If you use color_xterm (or rxvt) the correct value might be
+   xterm-color, xtermc or simply xterm.
+
+   If you use Linux console the correct value for TERM is linux or
+   console.
+
+4.6 My color_xterm goes completely (or partially) black!
+
+   Some color_xterm terminals define all colors as black instead of the
+   standard ANSI colors.  This makes them go completely black when you
+   try to use Midnight Commander with colors.
+
+   You will have to override the defaults.  Create a file
+   "color.defaults" which has the following contents:
+
+    color_xterm*color0:           Black
+    color_xterm*color1:           Red
+    color_xterm*color2:           Green
+    color_xterm*color3:           Yellow
+    color_xterm*color4:           Blue
+    color_xterm*color5:           Magenta
+    color_xterm*color6:           Cyan
+    color_xterm*color7:           White
+    color_xterm*background:       White
+    color_xterm*foreground:       Black
+
+   (replace color_xterm with the name of your color_xterm, color_xterm
+   mentions its name in its title bar)
+
+   Now type:
+
+    xrdb -merge color.defaults
+
+   Alternatively you can add the suggested contents of the
+   color.defaults file to your .Xdefaults or .Xresources file (or what
+   ever the name of your X configuration file is).  Or you can replace
+   your non-ANSI color_xterm with an ANSI color_xterm.
+
+4.7 Where can I get xterm or rxvt?
+
+   xterm is included with the X Window System, so you probably already
+   have it if you have X.  This version is not actively maintained, but
+   Thomas Dickey maintains his more advanced version of xterm at
+   ftp://dickey.his.com/xterm/
+
+   rxvt has its own site http://www.rxvt.org/ - get the latest version
+   there.
+
+4.8 I got colors working with MC but the other programs don't work at
+all anymore!
+
+   Midnight Commander uses terminfo database (if available) but many
+   other programs use termcap database.  If you set the TERM environment
+   variable to a value which has no corresponding entry in termcap
+   database those programs stop working.  You should add the new value
+   of TERM to the termcap database.
+
+   Example: If you have set TERM to xterm-color locate from /etc/termcap
+   the line which starts:
+
+    xterm|vs100|xterm terminal emulator
+
+   Change it to start:
+
+    xterm|xterm-color|vs100|xterm terminal emulator
+
+4.9 Why are there both terminfo and termcap? Wouldn't one database be
+enough?
+
+   You might want to read the Unix-Haters Handbook at
+   http://catalog.com/hopkins/unix-haters/handbook.html.  It lists many
+   more reasons why Unix sucks.
+
+   You can configure which terminal database you want to use with the
+   "--with-termcap" and "--with-terminfo" flags of configure.  If you
+   don't specify them, the configure script will try to use terminfo if
+   available otherwise it will use termcap.
+
+
+5 Graphical user interface
+
+5.1 Xview, Tk and Gnome editions?
+
+   Xview and Tk and GNOME editions have been removed from the sources.
+
+5.2 Why is MC linked with X libraries?
+
+   GNU Midnight Commander is linked with X libraries to read key
+   modifiers from the X Server.  It may be helpful to distinguish
+   between keys that the terminal emulator reports in the same way, e.g.
+   PgUp and Ctrl-PgUp.  Versions of GNU Midnight Commander after 4.6.0
+   will load X libraries dynamically on the systems that support it.
+
+
+6 Command line problems
+
+6.1 How do I stay in the last directory when I exit Midnight Commander?
+
+   See the description of the -P option in the Options section of the
+   manual.
+
+6.2 How can I access command line history?
+
+   Alt-h shows the last commands you executed from the command line.
+   Duplicates are suppressed from the history.  Commands executed from
+   the subshell prompt are not shown.
+
+   You can put previous commands to the command line with Alt-p.  Alt-n
+   moves you forward in history.
+
+   Since version 4.1.15 all the input widgets have permanent history.
+   You can summon the history listbox by pressing M-h.
+
+6.3 How can I complete commands, file names, variable names and so on?
+
+   Just press M-Tab.  Press M-Tab again to get a listbox if there are
+   multiple possible completions.
+
+6.4 I am using ksh.  Can I use functions defined in the .kshrc within
+MC?
+
+   Sorry, MC only supports bash, tcsh and zsh functions.  Ksh functions
+   are not supported because ksh lacks the necessary hooks needed for
+   subshell integration.
+
+   Switch to bash or zsh.  They are both quite compatible with ksh. 
+   Your ksh functions should work as such or after minimal changes.
+
+6.5 Is there any way to include additional options or hot keys to MC?
+
+   Yes, F2 invokes an user menu,  which is fully configurable.  You can
+   add any shell commands to the user menu.  See the mc(1) man page for
+   more info.
+
+   Another way to add functionality is the external panelize feature.
+   See the mc(1) man page for more info.
+
+   And finally, you can code any feature you want yourself.  MC source
+   code is free which means you can change it anyway you want.  There
+   are some limitations to make sure MC stays free.  See GNU General
+   Public License for details.
+
+6.6 When I use Ctrl-O I don't get a subshell.  How do I fix this?
+
+   Only bash, tcsh and zsh can be used as subshell.  Use one of those
+   shells as your default shell, and it will be used as subshell in GNU
+   Midnight Commander.
+
+6.7 Ctrl-O doesn't work at all.  What happens?
+
+   Ctrl-O works if either the subshell is used or the terminal can save
+   the output of the commands so it can be restored.  If neither is
+   true, there is absolutely nothing interesting behind the panels!
+
+   Only few terminals support screen saving.  It's xterm, rxvt and other
+   xterm-like terminals and virtual terminals on Linux and FreeBSD.
+
+
+7 Virtual file systems
+
+7.1 How can I see the contents of a tar archive?
+
+   If you use keyboard just move the selection bar on the tar file and
+   press enter.  If you use mouse just double-click on the tar file.
+
+   The recognized suffixes for tar archives are .tar, .tar.gz and .tgz.
+   You can also enter a tar archive by typing "cd filename#utar" where
+   filename is the name of the archive.  In this case, the suffix is not
+   important.
+
+7.2 How do I get out of a tar archive?
+
+   Just press enter on the toplevel ".." file or change to a non-tar
+   directory.  Just typing "cd" with no parameters is enough (it will
+   take you to your home directory).
+
+7.3 How do I do anonymous ftp with MC?
+
+   Just type "cd ftp://hostname" where hostname is the name of the host
+   you want to connect.  Alternatively, select FTP link from the Left or
+   Right menu and type the name of the host you want to connect.
+
+7.4 How do I do non-anonymous ftp with MC?
+
+   Non-anonymous ftp works just like the anonymous ftp but you give the
+   login name with the host name.  For example, type "cd
+   ftp://username@hostname".
+
+7.5 How do I close an ftp connection?
+
+   Just change to a non-ftp directory.  Simply typing "cd" with no
+   parameters is enough (it will take you to your home directory).
+
+   GNU Midnight Commander closes ftp connection automatically after a
+   timeout or on exit.  It's possible to force disconnect by selecting
+   "Command" -> "Active VFS List" in the menu and using the "Free VFSs
+   Now" button.
+
+7.6 Why aren't the contents of ftp panel updated?
+
+   Update is skipped because there would be a serious performance
+   penalty.  Constantly updating directory panels through a ftp
+   connection would take too much time.
+
+   You can use C-r to force an update.
+
+7.7 What kind of proxy server works with Midnight Commander?
+
+   There are two kinds of ftp proxies: proxies for ftp clients and
+   proxies for web browsers.
+
+   Midnight Commander only supports ftp proxies which are meant for ftp
+   clients.  Common WWW proxies (like Squid) are not supported.  A rule
+   of thumb is that if a ftp proxy requires a web browser, it won't work
+   with Midnight Commander.
+
+
+8 Other common problems
+
+8.1 When I try pasting to the internal editor, it indents the amount of
+indenting increases with each line!
+
+   Either turn off 'Return does autoindent' in the editor options or
+   update GNU Midnight Commander to version 4.6.0 or above - it doesn't
+   autoindent when you are holding Shift.
+
+8.2 Is it possible to use Colorer for syntax highlighting?
+
+   Yes if you submit the patch.  There are no legal problems with it
+   because it's licensed under GPL now.  The homepage of Colorer is
+   http://colorer.sourceforge.net/
+
+
+9 Other common problems
+
+9.1 Is there any way to 'bookmark' favorite ftp-fs links?
+
+   Use the directory hotlist.  Just press control-backslash.  If your
+   national keyboard layout doesn't have backslash key, just press the
+   control key with the key which is the backslash key in the English
+   keyboard layout.
+
+9.2 When I start Midnight Commander, nothing happens!
+
+   When MC is compiled with Samba support, have a look at the
+   "interfaces = ..." line in your smb.conf file. MC uses pretty old
+   Samba code that only expects IP addresses and host names there,
+   but not network interface names (like eth0). MC interprets these
+   names as host names and tries to resolve them using a DNS server.
+   To fix this, ask your system administrator to change the interface
+   names to their assigned IP addresses, or (untried) add the interface
+   names and their IP addresses to the /etc/hosts file.
+
+   First, invoke MC without subshell support: "mc -u".  If this helps
+   check the shell you are using.  Subshell support works best with
+   bash, although tcsh and zsh are also supported.  You might want to
+   upgrade your shell to a newer version.  If you use something else
+   than bash, tcsh or zsh, subshell support is disabled automatically.
+
+   If disabling subshell doesn't help, try to reconfigure MC with
+   "--with-included-slang" and "--with-termcap" options and recompile.
+   If this helps, something is wrong with your terminfo database or
+   shared S-Lang library.  For better terminfo databases see chapter 4
+   of this FAQ.  For a better S-Lang library, upgrade to a newer version
+   or keep using the "--with-included-slang" option.
+
+   Another reason is problems with gpm.  Try using "--nomouse" option to
+   see if it makes any difference.  Restarting gpm can help.  Sometimes
+   it's enough to move the mouse.
+
+   Also, if you have the DISPLAY environment variable set, but the X
+   server is unreachable (e.g. it's firewalled), this can also cause a
+   delay at startup.  Unset DISPLAY to see if that's the case.
+
+
+10 Development
+
+10.1 Who has written Midnight Commander?
+
+   Midnight Commander was started by Miguel de Icaza and he is the
+   maintainer of the package.  Other authors have joined the project
+   later:
+     * Mauricio Plaza (early releases)
+     * Janne Kukonlehto (joined Sep 27 1994)
+     * Radek Doulik (joined Oct 30 1994)
+     * Fred Leeflang (joined Nov 2 1994)
+     * Dugan Porter (joined Dec 1 1994)
+     * Jakub Jelinek (joined Feb 8 1995)
+     * Ching Hui (joined Jun 27 1995)
+     * Andrej Borsenkow (joined Jul 1996)
+     * Paul Sheer (joined Nov 1 1996)
+     * Norbert Warmuth
+     * Alex I. Tkachenko
+
+   Alessandro Rubini has been specially helpful with debugging and
+   enhancing of the mouse support.  John E. Davis has made his S-Lang
+   library available to us and answered many questions about it.
+
+   Many people have contributed bug reports, feature suggestions and
+   small code bits (alphabetical order):
+     * Thomasz Cholewo
+     * Juan Jose Ciarlante
+     * Alexander Dong (OS/2 port, NT port updates)
+     * Erwin van Eijk
+     * Torben Fjerdingstad
+     * Massimo Fontanelli
+     * Juan Grigera (NT port)
+     * Gerd Knorr
+     * Sergey Ya. Korshunoff
+     * Jean-Daniel Luiset
+     * Wim Osterholt
+     * Antonio Palama (old DOS port)
+     * Thomas Pundt
+     * Marcelo Roccasalva
+     * Ilya Rybkin
+     * Vadim Sinolits
+     * Jon Stevens
+     * Adam Tla/lka
+
+10.2 Do I dare to use a development version?
+
+   That's up to you to decide.  Development versions may have nasty bugs
+   at some points of time.  It's up to you to judge whether the new
+   features and fixes for the bugs you know outweigh the risk of unknown
+   bugs.
+
+10.3 How can I report a bug/request for a feature?
+
+   You might first want to get the newest development version to see if
+   the bug is fixed or the feature is added already.
+
+   Send your report/request to mc-devel@gnome.org or mc@gnome.org. 
+   These mailing lists are the most certain way to contact the
+   developers.  Remember to mention if you are not on the mailing list
+   to make sure that you will receive a copy of replies.
+
+   Give as much details as possible.  A too long message is a lot better
+   than a too short message.
+
+   For segmentation faults a stack backtrace is appreciated.  You can
+   produce stack backtrace as follows:
+     * If segmentation fault produced a core file:
+         1. Load the core file by typing "gdb mc core" or "dbx mc core".
+         2. Type "where".
+         3. Cut and paste the results to your message.
+     * If segmentation fault didn't produce a core file:
+         1. Load mc by typing "gdb mc" or "dbx mc".
+         2. Start mc by typing "run".
+         3. Try to reproduce the segmentation fault by doing whatever
+            you did last time when the segmentation fault occurred.
+         4. Type "where".
+         5. Cut and paste the results to your message.
+         6. For the future you might want to check out what is the
+            command in your shell to allow producing of the core files.
+            Usually it is "limit coredumpsize unlimited" or "ulimit
+            coredumpsize" or "ulimit -c unlimited".
+
+10.4 How can I join the development?
+
+   To join the development just code the feature you want to add and
+   send your patch for inclusion.  Email address is mc-devel@gnome.org.
+   Before you start coding check the latest development version.  It
+   might be that your feature has already been implemented.
+
+   Note that the authors of GNU Midnight Commander have given all their
+   rights on the program to the Free Software Foundation.  You will have
+   to do the same if you contribute non-trivial patches.  Otherwise we
+   have to reject your patches in order to avoid copyright problems.
+
+

+This document
+=============
+
+This document is a guide how to develop GNU Midnight Commander.  It's
+quite incomplete, but may be worth reading anyway.
+
+The document was written by Miguel de Icaza and reworked by Pavel
+Roskin.  Some parts were taken from the messages posted in the mailing
+lists.
+
+
+Compiling from CVS
+==================
+
+To compile GNU Midnight commander from CVS, the following software is
+required:
+
+Autoconf 2.52 and above (latest is recommended)
+Automake 1.5 and above (latest is recommended)
+Gettext 0.11.5 and above
+Glib 1.2.6 and above (2.x is recommended)
+
+It is recommended that all those tools are installed with the same
+prefix.  Make sure that the tools with the right version are first in
+PATH.
+
+Once you have the right tools, run `autogen.sh' - it will generate
+everything necessary for the build and run `configure'.  Arguments given
+to `autogen.sh' are passed to `configure'.  Then run `make' as usually.
+
+The distribution tarball is created by the command `make distcheck'. 
+This command can take a while.
+
+Currently snapshots are made on Debian unstable and use the versions of
+the tools from the unstable repository.  Yes, the rpm packages are made
+on Debian too.
+
+Note that the version of gettext doesn't affect the snapshot because the
+distributed files are installed by gettext from archives for the version
+used in the AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION macro, which is 0.11.5.
+
+
+
+Working with GNU Midnight Commander
+===================================
+
+Please use the CVS version.  It may be quite different from the released
+versions.  A lot of cleanup is going on.  The CVS version may be easier
+to understand, in addition to the obvious fact that the merging is
+easier with the CVS version.
+
+There are some tools in the maint directory on CVS.  They are not
+included with releases or snapshots.  You may be interested to look at
+them if you are going to work on the project for an extended period of
+time.  In particular, the release procedure is described there.
+
+In order to compile GNU Midnight Commander from a clean CVS checkout you
+should use autogen.sh instead of configure.  Arguments passed to
+autogen.sh are passed to configure after it's generated.
+
+GNU Midnight Commander uses Autoconf and Automake, with make it fairly
+portable.  However, GNU Make is strongly recommended for development
+because other versions of make may not track dependencies properly. 
+This is very important for correct compilation, especially if you change
+any header files.
+
+If you add or remove any files, please change Makefile.am in the same
+directory accordingly.  When doing significant changes in the tree
+structure, "make distcheck" is strongly recommended.
+
+If you have etags installed, you can run "make tags" and use tags in
+emacs to find functions or variables.  But you can also use the internal
+editor and the "Find File" command to find any text in the source tree.
+
+GNU Autoconf allows you to test several different configurations are
+once.  To do so, use the so called out-of-tree (or VPATH) compilation. 
+Create separate empty directories and run configure with full path from
+those directories, like this:
+
+cd /usr/local/src
+mkdir mc-slang
+mkdir mc-ncurses
+cd mc-slang
+/usr/local/src/mc/configure && make all
+cd ../mc-ncurses
+/usr/local/src/mc/configure --with-screen=ncurses && make all
+
+Please use the same indentation as other developers.  To indent a block,
+select in the internal editor and use Shift-F9 to call the external
+indent.  For historic reasons, GNU Midnight Commander used formatting
+that is not default for GNU Indent.  Please put following text to your
+~/.indent.pro file to make GNU Indent follow the style used in GNU
+Midnight Commander:
+
+-kr -i4 -pcs -psl --ignore-newlines
+
+It's OK to indent the whole function if you edit it.  However, please
+refrain from it if you are posting your patch for review.  In this case
+you would save time of other developers if you only include significant
+changes.  The developer applying your patch can format the code for you.
+
+Please keep in mind that the VFS subsystem is licensed under LGPL, while
+the rest of the code uses GPL.
+
+
+Code structure - outline
+========================
+
+The code is located in following directories.
+
+vfs - Virtual File System.
+
+This library provides filesystem-like access to various data, such are
+archives and remote filesystems.  To use VFS, you should use wrappers
+around POSIX calls.  The wrappers have names composed from "mc_" and the
+standard name of the function.  For example, to open a file on VFS, use
+mc_open() instead.
+
+edit - the internal editor.
+
+This code has been contributed by Paul Sheer, the author of Cooledit. 
+The internal editor shares some code with Cooledit, but now it's
+developed as part of GNU Midnight Commander.
+
+src - the main part of the code.
+
+This code includes the dialog manager written by Radek Doulik and source
+code of the main application.
+
+slang - stripped down S-Lang library.
+
+It's provided to allow compilation that don't have the S-Lang library
+with complete headers or the library is broken.  Please avoid changing
+this code.  If you do change it, please consider contributing your
+changes to the maintainers of S-Lang.
+
+
+Code structure - details
+========================
+
+GNU Midnight Commander uses extensively the dialog manager written by
+Radek Doulik.  To understand how the dialog manager works, please read
+the dialog.c.  You will find the basic widgets in the files widget.c. 
+Some more high-level functions, e.g. to display a message box, are
+located in wtools.c.  This file also contains the Quick Dialog code,
+which makes it easier to create complex dialogs.
+
+Files findme.c, popt.c, poptconfig.c, popthelp.c and poptparse.c come
+from the popt library used to parse the command line.  They should not
+be modified unless absolutely necessary.
+
+The files util.c and utilunix.c have a lot of utility functions.  Get
+familiar with them, they are very simple. 
+
+glib is used for memory allocation and for some utility functions, such
+as manipulation with lists and trees.  gmodule (part of the glib
+distribution) is used to load some libraries dynamically at the run
+time.
+
+Thanks to glib, the code has almost no hardcoded limits, since there are
+many ways to avoid them.  For example, when you want to concatenate
+strings, use the g_strconcat() function:
+
+	new_text = g_strconcat (username, " ", password, (char *)0);
+
+This allocates new memory for the string, so you should use g_free() on
+the result.
+
+The parent of all dialogs is called midnight_dlg.  Both panels are
+widgets in that dialog.  Other widgets include the menu, the command
+line and the button bar.
+
+
+Input handling
+==============
+
+The routines for input handling on the Midnight Commander are:
+getch, get_key_code, mi_getch and get_event.
+
+getch is an interface to the low level system input mechanism.  It
+does not deal with the mouse.  
+
+    In the case of ncurses, this is a function implemented in the
+    ncurses library that translates key sequences to key codes (\E[A to
+    something like KEY_UP and so on).
+
+    In the case of S-Lang there is no such conversion, that's why we
+    load a set of extra definitions.
+
+The get_key_code routine converts the data from getch to the
+constants the Midnight Commander uses.
+
+    In the case of S-Lang, it will actually do all the jobs that getch
+    does for curses.  In the case of curses it patches a couple of
+    sequences that are not available on some terminal databases.  This
+    routine is the one you want to use if you want a character without
+    the mouse support.
+
+get_event is the routine you want to use if you want to handle mouse
+events, it will return 0 on a mouse event, -1 if no input is available
+or a key code if there is some input available.  This routine in turn
+uses get_key_code to decode the input stream and convert it to useful
+constants.
+
+mi_getch is just a wrapper around get_event that ignores all the mouse
+events.  It's used only in a couple of places, this routine may return
+-1 if no input is available (if you have set the nodelay option of
+ncurses or S-Lang with nodelay) or a character code if no such option is
+available. 
+
+
+Mouse support
+=============
+
+The mouse support in the Midnight Commander is based on the get_event
+routine.  The core of the mouse event dispatching is in the
+dlg.c:run_dlg routine.
+
+
+ncurses
+=======
+
+Although S-Lang is now used by default, we still support ncurses.  We
+basically are using a small subset of ncurses because we want to be
+compatible with Slang.
+
+
+The Dialog manager and the Widgets
+==================================
+
+The Dialog manager and the Widget structure are implemented in
+src/dialog.c.  Everything shown on screen is a dialog.  Dialogs contain
+widgets, but not everything on screen is a widget.  Dialogs can draw
+themselves.
+
+Dialogs are connected into a singly linked list using "parent" field. 
+Currently active dialog is saved in current_dlg variable.  The toplevel
+dialog has parent NULL.  Usually it's midnight_dlg.
+
+            parent                  parent
+current_dlg ------->another dialog-- ... -->midnight_dlg
+
+When the screen needs to be refreshed, every dialog asks its parent to
+refresh first, and then refreshes itself.
+
+A dialog is created by create_dlg().  Then it's populated by widgets
+using add_widget().  Then the dialog is run by calling run_dlg(), which
+returns the id of the button selected by the user.  Finally, the dialog
+is destroyed by calling destroy_dlg().
+
+Widgets are placed to a doubly linked circular list.  Each widget has
+previous and next widget.
+
+        prev   next         prev   next
+widget1 <---------> widget2 <---------> widget3
+   ^                                       ^
+   -----------------------------------------
+   next                                 prev
+
+Pressing Tab moves focus to the "next" widget, pressing Shift-Tab moves
+focus to "prev".  The tab order is equal to the add order except some
+old code that use the reverse order by setting DLG_REVERSE flag in
+create_dlg() call.  Please don't use reverse order in the new code.
+
+The initial widget to get focus can be selected by calling
+dlg_select_widget().
+
+When creating a dialog, you may want to use a callback that would
+intercept some dialog events.  However, many widgets will do the right
+thing by default, so some dialogs can work just fine without callbacks.
+
+There are also widget events, which are sent by the dialog to individual
+widgets.  Some widgets also have user callbacks.
+
+To create your own widget, use init_widget().  In this case, you must
+provide a callback function.  Please note that it's not the same as the
+user callback in some widgets.
+
+

+
+Programming Tips
+================
+
+(This list should be sorted alphabetically.)
+
+?: This operator has a precedence that is easy to use the wrong way. You
+	might think that
+
+		int right = 25 + have_frame() ? 1 : 0; /* WRONG */
+
+	results in either 25 or 26. This is not the case. The C compiler
+	sees this as:
+
+		int right = (25 + have_frame()) ? 1 : 0; /* WRONG */
+
+	To avoid this, put the ?: in parentheses, like this
+
+		int right = 25 + (have_frame() ? 1 : 0); /* RIGHT */
+
+	If the condition is more complicated, put it in additional
+	parentheses:
+
+		int right = 25 + ((have_frame()) ? 1 : 0); /* RIGHT */
+
+const: For every function taking a string argument, decide whether you
+	(as a user of the function) would expect that the string is modi-
+	fied by the function. If not, declare the string argument as
+	"const char *". If your implementation needs to modify the string,
+	use g_strdup to create a local copy.
+
+const_cast: Has been replaced by str_unconst.
+
+g_free: g_free handles NULL argument too, no need for the comparison.
+	Bad way:
+	    if (old_dir) g_free (old_dir);
+	Right way:
+	    g_free (old_dir);
+
+g_strdup: When you use g_strdup to create a local copy of a string, use
+	the following pattern to keep the reference.
+
+	char * const pathref = g_strdup(argument);
+	/* ... */
+	g_free (pathref);
+
+	The "const" will make the pointer unmodifiable (pathref++
+	is not possible), but you can still modify the string contents.
+	
+g_strlcpy: Whenever you use this function, be sure to add "glibcompat.h"
+	to the included headers. This is because in glib-1.2 there is
+	no such function.
+
+NULL: When you pass NULL as an argument of a varargs function, cast the
+	0 to the appropriate data type. If a system #defines NULL to
+	be 0 (at least NetBSD and OpenBSD do), and the sizes of int and
+	a pointer are different, the argument will be passed as int 0,
+	not as a pointer.
+
+	This tip applies at least to catstrs (edit/edit.h), execl(3),
+	execle(3), execlp(3), g_strconcat (glib), parent_call
+	(src/background.h), parent_call_string (src/background.h),
+	rpc_get (vfs/mcfsutil.h), rpc_send (vfs/mcfsutil.h).
+
+	example:
+	char *path = g_strconcat("dir", "/", "file", (char *)0);
+
+size_t: This data type is suitable for expressing sizes of memory or the
+	length of strings. This type is unsigned, so you need not check
+	if the value is >= 0.
+
+strncpy: Don't use this function in newly created code. It is slow, insecure
+	and hard to use. A much better alternative is g_strlcpy (see there).
+
+str_unconst: We use many libraries that do not know about "const char *"
+	and thus declare their functions to require "char *". If you
+	know for sure that an external function does not modify the
+	string, you can "unconst" a string using the function
+	str_unconst(). If you are not sure whether the function modifies
+	the string, you should use g_strdup() to pass a copy of a string
+	to the function. Don't forget to call g_free() after work is done.
+
+unused: Unused arguments of a function can be marked like this:
+
+	void do_nothing(int data)
+	{
+	    (void) &data;
+	}
+
+	This tells the GNU C Compiler not to emit a warning, and has no
+	side effects for other compilers.

+Installation instructions for GNU Midnight Commander
+----------------------------------------------------
+
+The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and creates
+the makefiles.  It also creates a file `config.status' that you can run
+in the future to recreate the current configuration.
+
+To compile this package:
+
+1.  Configure the package for your system.
+
+Normally, you just `cd' to the directory containing the package's source
+code and type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old version of
+SystemV, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to prevent `csh'
+from trying to execute `configure' itself.  Under AIX, you may need to
+use ksh instead of sh.
+
+Running `configure' takes a while.  While it is running, it prints some
+messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to see any
+messages, run `configure' with the `--quiet' option.
+
+To compile the package in a different directory than the one containing
+the source code, you must use a version of `make' supporting the `VPATH'
+variable, such as GNU `make'.  Change to the directory where you want
+the object files and executables to go and run the `configure' script
+with the full path.  If for some reason `configure' cannot find the
+source code directory, run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR',
+where DIR is the directory that contains the source code.
+
+By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
+`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
+installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
+option `--prefix=PATH'.
+
+You can specify separate installation prefixes for architecture specific
+files and architecture-independent files.  If you give `configure' the
+option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH as the prefix for
+installing binary programs and libraries.  Data files and documentation
+will still use the regular prefix.  Normally, all files are installed
+using the same prefix.
+
+If compiled on GNU/Linux, Midnight Commander detects if you have the gpm
+library installed.  If you installed the gpm mouse library in a
+non-standard place, you will need to use the --with-gpm-mouse flag with
+the directory base where you installed the gpm package.
+
+`configure' recognizes the following options (the list may be
+incomplete, use `configure --help' to get the full list):
+
+`--help'
+     Print a summary of the options to `configure' and exit.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.
+
+`--verbose'
+     Print the results of the checks.
+
+`--version'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--without-edit'
+     Configure GNU Midnight Commander to be compiled without the
+     built-in file editor.  The built-in editor is compiled in by
+     default.
+
+`--with-ext2undel'
+     On systems that use the ext2 or ext3 file system and have the
+     libext2fs library available, this option adds support for
+     recovering deleted files (the undel virtual file system). 
+
+`--without-gpm-mouse'
+     Use this flag to disable gpm mouse support (e.g. if you want to
+     use mouse only on X terminals).
+
+`--with-glib12'
+     Force using glib 1.2.x even if glib 2.0.x is present.  Use this
+     flag for testing or if you want to use the binary on systems that
+     don't have glib 2.0.x installed.
+
+`--with-glib-static'
+     Force linking against glib statically.  This option is intended for
+     building binaries for distribution purposes and may not work on
+     some operating systems.
+
+`--with-mmap', `--without-mmap'
+     Force using or not using the mmap function.  It is currently used
+     in the internal viewer.  `--with-mmap' may be useful on some
+     versions of AIX where the `configure' script decides that mmap is
+     broken, but it's actually suitable for the internal viewer.
+
+`--with-subshell[=optional]', `--without-subshell' 
+     The subshell support is by default turned on, you can disable
+     this by using the --without-subshell option.  If you pass the
+     =optional parameter, then the subshell support is turned off by
+     default.  To turn it on, specify the `-U' option to the program.
+
+`--without-x'
+     By default, the Midnight Commander tries to connect to the X Window
+     System events to query the status of the keyboard modifiers, such
+     as Control, Shift and Alt, when invoked in a terminal emulator
+     under X11.  This is necessary (but not always sufficient) to
+     recognize some optional but handy key combinations like Ctrl-Home
+     and Shift-Cursor keys.  Use `--without-x' if the dependency on
+     X11 libraries is not desired.
+
+`--without-vfs'
+     This option disables the Virtual File System switch code in the
+     Midnight Commander and uses the standard file system calls for
+     file access.  If you specify this option, you won't get the
+     transparent access to archives and remote directories.
+
+`--with-mcfs'
+     This option enables mcfs - a non-standard remote filesystem
+     designed specifically for the Midnight Commander.  It also enables
+     a server for that filesystem, mcserv.  Please note that the
+     implementation of mcfs is not optimized for speed.  There may be
+     security issues with mcserv - don't run it if you don't need it.
+
+`--with-samba'
+     This option enables remote VFS over the SMB protocol.  A stripped
+     down version of samba distributed with the sources is compiled and
+     linked with the mc executable.  It is recommended that you install
+     Samba client, since mc uses some files from Samba under certain
+     conditions.  Please visit http://www.samba.org/ to learn more.
+
+`--disable-largefile'
+     This option disables support for large files (2 gigabytes and more)
+     on the systems where file operations use 32-bit offsets by default,
+     but support for 64-bit offsets is available.  May be useful for
+     slow processors and embedded systems.
+
+`--enable-charset'
+     This option adds support for selecting character set of the text in
+     the internal viewer and editor and converting it on the fly.  The
+     implementation of this option is currently incomplete.
+
+`--disable-background'
+     This option disables support for background operations.  Background
+     operations allow to perform some tasks such as copying files in a
+     separate background process.  Any messages from the background
+     process are forwarded to the foreground process.  More advanced
+     dialogs cannot be forwarded yet, so the background process uses the
+     default.  Background code is known to be less stable than the rest
+     of the code, so you may want to disable it at the compile time.
+
+`--disable-netcode'
+     This option disables support for networked virtual filesystems.
+     It's primarily used by developers to make sure that the code would
+     compile and run on operating systems that lack POSIX compatible
+     network support.  But you can use it is you know that you won't be
+     accessing remote filesystems from GNU Midnight Commander.
+
+You may also tell configure which screen library you want to use with
+the Midnight Commander.  The configure script will use S-Lang as
+default, and prefers an already installed S-Lang library over the
+included one, but you can override this by using the following flag
+(please note that since S-Lang is default, it is tested better than
+ncurses):
+
+`--with-screen={slang|mcslang|ncurses}'
+     Choose the library used to manage interaction with the terminal.
+     `slang' means S-Lang library already installed on the system,
+     `mcslang' means S-Lang library included with the sources of
+     GNU Midnight Commander, `ncurses' means ncurses library already
+     installed on the system.  The installed S-Lang library is used
+     by default if found, otherwise the included S-Lang library is
+     used.
+
+`--with-termcap'
+     If the included S-Lang library is used, this option forces it to
+     use the termcap database, as opposed to the default terminfo
+     database.
+
+On systems that require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the package's `configure' script does not know about, you can give
+`configure' initial values for variables by placing them in the command
+line:
+
+./configure CC='gcc -traditional' LIBS=-lposix
+
+Here are the variables that you might want to override when running
+`configure'.
+
+ - Variable: CC
+     C compiler program.  The default is `gcc' if found, otherwise `cc'.
+
+ - Variable: CFLAGS
+     The default flags used to build the program.
+
+ - Variable: INSTALL
+     Program to use to install files.  The default is `install' if you
+     have it, `cp' otherwise.
+
+For these variables, any value given in the command line is added to the
+value that `configure' decides to use:
+
+ - Variable: LIBS
+     Libraries to link with, in the form `-lfoo -lbar...'.
+
+ - Variable: LDFLAGS
+     Linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+     nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+
+ - Variable: CPPFLAGS
+     C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
+     headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+
+If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
+you to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
+mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the README so we can
+include them in the next release.
+
+2.  Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+3.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and the
+documentation.  On GNU/Linux the console screen saver is installed as
+well.
+
+4.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
+directory by typing `make clean'.  If you want to clean the source tree
+completely, so that it contains only those files that should be packaged
+in the archive, issue `make distclean'.  If you've run configure in a
+different directory than the source tree, distclean won't remove your
+*.o and linked programs in that directory.
+
+5.  GNU Midnight Commander allows you to stay in the last current
+directory after exiting MC.  This is done with a shell function, the man
+page has more information about this.
+
+The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
+called `autoconf'.  You only need it if you want to regenerate
+`configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

+Notes about GNU Midnight Commander installation
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+GNU Midnight Commander has been run in the following configurations:
+
+i386-*-linux
+sparc-*-linux
+alpha-*-linux
+powerpc-*-linux
+mips-dec-ultrix4.3
+mips-dec-{open,net}bsd1.0

+i386-*-bsdi2
+i386-*-freebsd4.3
+i386-*-openbsd2.9
+
+Midnight Commander is written in a portable manner and uses GNU Autoconf
+for configuration, so it is expected to compile without changes on many
+other operating systems.
+
+You will need an ANSI C Compiler (such as GCC) and glib library to
+compile the source.  GNU Midnight Commander now comes with the S-Lang
+screen manager, a fast screen manager, but you may want to use the
+already installed S-Lang or ncurses library.
+
+If you insist on using ncurses, it's recommended to use ncurses 4.1 and
+above, since the older versions don't support resizing in the xterm
+window.
+
+GNU Midnight Commander comes with the mouse support on xterms and in the
+Linux console.  In order to take advantage of the mouse support on the
+Linux console you will need the gpm mouse server (see the section
+"Obtaining related software" in this file).
+
+Once you get gpm, compile it and install it, then you will have to
+specify the `--with-gpm-mouse' flag to the configure program if you
+installed it in a non-standard directory.  If you installed the gpm
+package under /usr or /usr/local, you don't need to specify this flag;
+configure will find gpm for you.  The support for mice on xterms is
+always compiled in.
+
+We are working on further enhancements to the program, but we're not
+sure which ones must go first.  If you would like to point us in the
+Right Direction we will be glad to hear from you (you could check the
+file TODO included with this distribution for the current projects).
+
+If you happen to find a feature that doesn't do what you expect, please
+write to mc@gnome.org telling as much as you can about the problem
+you're experiencing.  Please don't send personal messages to the
+maintainers.
+
+
+Obtaining related software
+--------------------------
+
+glib
+----
+
+The only "hard" dependency of GNU Midnight Commander is glib.  You can
+get glib from
+
+ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/
+
+Note that only versions 1.2.x and 2.0.x are supported.  Newer versions
+may work, but haven't been tested.
+
+Terminal database
+-----------------
+
+There are many incomplete terminal databases out there, however, a
+complete terminfo is bundled with ncurses.  (It is simple to generate
+the termcap database using the infocmp utility in ncurses).
+
+Some terminfo data are included with the mc distribution (lib/*.ti).
+Particularly linux, xterm and vt100. Use e.g. ''tic linux.ti'' to use
+them.
+
+If you want to run mc on xterm/color_xterm/ansi_xterm (not rxvt), then
+you might read lib/README.xterm for further information.
+
+Screen libraries
+----------------
+
+GNU Midnight Commander can use the included version of S-Lang, but you
+can get the latest version here:
+
+http://www.s-lang.org/
+
+Alternatively, you can use ncurses:
+
+http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html
+
+Mouse support
+-------------
+
+The general purpose mouse (gpm) daemon is available from
+
+ftp://arcana.linux.it/pub/gpm/
+
+Compiler
+--------
+
+If your C compiler is not powerful enough to compile GNU Midnight
+Commander, you should report is as a bug to the GNU Midnight Commander
+team.  Sometimes there is no solution than upgrading to a modern and
+free compiler - GCC (Compiler Collection):

+Read the INSTALL file for the complete instructions. 
+
+GNU Midnight Commander requires glib.  Currently the 1.2.x and 2.0.x
+series are supported.  You may already have glib installed, but if you
+don't, take it from ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/
+
+GNU Midnight Commander uses the S-Lang screen library by default. It
+tries the S-Lang library installed on the system.  If it's not found,
+the included S-Lang sources are used.  It is also possible to use
+ncurses as the screen library.
+
+1. Configure the package for your system.
+
+Normally, you just `cd' to the package main directory and type
+`./configure'.
+
+The most often needed options to configure are following:
+
+`--prefix=PATH'
+	By default, `make install' will install the package's files
+	in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc. or to `/usr/bin',
+	`/usr/man', etc. depending on the location of an old mc binary.
+	If you have none in your system, default will be `/usr/local'.
+	You can specify an installation prefix other than default by
+	giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.
+
+`--with-screen={slang|mcslang|ncurses}'
+	Choose the library used to manage interaction with the terminal.
+	`slang' means S-Lang library already installed on the system,
+	`mcslang' means S-Lang library included with the sources of
+	GNU Midnight Commander, `ncurses' means ncurses library already
+	installed on the system.  The installed S-Lang library is used
+	by default if found, otherwise the included S-Lang library is
+	used.
+
+You may also want to specify CFLAGS for the compiler, even if it finds
+itself some defaults by typing e.g.
+
+./configure CFLAGS=-O3
+
+2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+3. Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
+documentation.  You may need to run this command as root.
+
+If you're on a GNU/Linux system, this will install the `cons.saver'
+utility, which allows the Midnight Commander to save and restore the
+screen contents.  This utility can be installed setuid root, but it's
+only needed on systems where users cannot access /dev/vcsaN, where N is
+the virtual console number, on which the uses is logged on.
+
+If you're making a mc binary distribution for other people and want to
+package the whole installed tree, use `make install DESTDIR=PATH', which
+will make PATH the root for installation.
+
+4. Type `mc' and enjoy!

+
+Version 3.0
+
+This has been finished:
+
+- Virtual File System: You now can browse tar, compressed tar and 
+  file systems over the network as if they were local subdirectories;
+- Slang support, you don't need ncurses anymore (but you can still compile
+  with ncurses, if you want).
+- New mc.ext format, for details see the sample mc.ext file provided.
+- Append option if you try to copy/move a file onto already existing one.
+- Internal cd command uses CDPATH variable if set (like in BASH).
+- Find file command is much faster.

+  criteria - actually spawns an external command and it can be find, awk,
+  grep -l or anything else.
+- Learn keys makes setting up of mc on terminals with broken
+  terminfo/termcap databases easier. It just asks you to press keys which
+  are not working.
+- Advanced chown command.

+  information on the screen better.  Now you can also specify the starting
+  mode for the viewer depending on the contents of the viewed file.
+- Mask rename and copy.
+- Colors now let you specify the intensity of the colors you want.
+
+This is being worked on:
+- Virtual File System: FTP file system.
+- Tcl/Tk and XView versions of the program (preliminary versions are
+  up and running).
+
+
+Version 2.0
+
+Now users are able to define their own display 
+
+- User defined display formats.
+
+  Now you can configure the file display to suit your needs.
+  For example, you can say which information you want to see displayed
+  instead of our defaults.
+
+- User definable program layout.
+
+  Panels could be shown vertically or horizontally;
+  panels could be different sizes, you can hide or show most
+  program windows (command line, keybar or menubar).
+
+- Output window.
+
+  Now, it's possible to see part of the last program output on the Linux
+  console without having to switch screens via an option in the layout
+  menu.
+
+- New View modes:
+
+     Quick view: as you browse your files, each one is displayed on
+                 the other panel on the idle time.
+
+     Tree view:  let's you browse your directories by traveling a tree.  
+		 We have two traveling modes available.  And the tree does
+  		 not take your precious time: it's build on the fly, as you
+                 browse your disk (you can always loose your time if you
+		 want to :-).
+
+     Info view:  Gives you information on the currently select file and
+                 the current file system as you move.
+
+     User view:  Let's you define a directory listing and the format you
+                 want to use.
+
+- New subshell support (concurrent shell execution)
+
+  The Midnight Commander will now spawn one copy of the shell, so you
+  get better performance and you can use shell functions, define variables
+  and execute complete shell commands.  Supported shells: bash, zsh and
+  tcsh.  If your shell is not supported, then the old mode is still
+  available.
+
+- Dialog box manager
+
+  Almost all the new configuration options are configured with this
+  new dialog manager, easy to use if you are familiar with dialog boxes
+  in DOS and Windows. 
+
+  Available widgets: check buttons, buttons, radio buttons, 
+  input lines and list boxes (So you can take our code and use it on
+  your applications).
+
+- New option configuration.
+
+  Now the program options are configured with a dialog box.
+
+- Chmod and Chown commands:
+
+  For changing permissions as well as ownership of files and
+  directories, uses our new dialog manager.  
+

+  Now you can change the default color of the program with any of
+  these:
+  environment variable, Colors section in the init file (colors per 
+  terminal type) and command line.
+
+- User menu and extension enhancements:
+
+  Execution understand the %t macro (tagged files). 
+
+  User menu also has a new macro to let the user specify options.
+
+  You can hide and show entries in the user menus by using conditions.
+
+  Auto detect best match depending on a regexp.
+
+- Viewer: 
+     Goto line command,
+     horizontal scrolling,
+     on the fly decompression (and we don't eat unneeded cycles of CPU),
+     allow non gunzip operation.
+
+- Internal move command:
+
+  Now, we don't rely anymore on system commands in /bin, so the
+  program is more robust and is much faster.  Bunches of code come
+  from the GNU fileutils.
+
+- The Tree view and normal views allows wrapped incremental searches of
+  file names.
+
+- Mask rename:
+
+  Now it's possible to do things like rename *.pas in *.bak
+
+- Compare directories command
+
+- Allow panels to be in Long mode without forcing the user to a single panel.
+
+  (You can even have two long panels).
+
+- F10, C-g cancels as well as ESC ESC.
+
+- Improved help system.
+  
+  We updated and spelled the help system and added a lots of links.
+  The Web page is constructed with the same tools.
+
+- Allows tagging of directories:
+
+  Now you can copy, rename, move and delete complete directories.  You
+  are not limited anymore to files.  
+
+- View output (screen save/restore) on Linux console.
+
+  On old Linux systems, only b&w is supported, on newer Linux systems
+  (1.1.67 and newer), we also support color screen save/restore and
+  cursor positions.
+
+- 8 bit clean support.
+
+- Visual feedback while i-searching files.
+
+- Much more intuitive, you have to use it.
+
+- It's better than aspirin.
+
+- New memory allocation debugger.
+
+  During testing time, we used a powerful memory allocation debugger,
+  so the program will not eat all your memory, and will make a good use of
+  your memory.  
+
+- Now it also runs on hppa-hp-hpux9, hppa-hp-hpux7, m68k-apple-aux and
+  sparc-sun-netbsd1.0.  The best platform to run it is Linux, of course,
+  since that's where most of us develop it.
+
+- Inode sort option.
+
+- Nice progress status indicator.
+
+  We have two of them: a moving dash indicator and a progress bar
+  indicator for file operations.
+
+Version 0.15
+
+- Uses GNU autoconf.
+   Currently, it has been ported to this configurations:
+   i386-*-linux1.0
+   i386-*-linux1.1
+   mips-sgi-irix5.2
+   mips-dec-ultrix4.3
+   rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5
+   sparc-sun-sunos4.1
+   sparc-sun-solaris2.3
+
+- Improvements to the internal file viewer:
+   Wrap/Unwrap mode.
+   Hex mode.
+   Hex searches.
+   Now you can view compressed files (gzip, compress, zip, pack and lzh).
+   Performance enhancements, now it's much faster.
+   Works on systems without mmap.
+
+- Mouse Support now also works on xterms.
+   If you run in the Linux console, you will still need the gpm mouse server
+   to use the mouse support, but if you use xterms, then you're lucky 
+   and can use the mouse support when using xterms.
+
+- Help system and man page.
+   Both were updated and has many more hypertext links inside, the
+   help system can also be used with a mouse.
+
+- If running on xterms, now you can see the output of the last program
+  you ran by using the C-o key combination.
+
+- Switch panels command (C-u)
+- With filter command per panel.

+Introduction
+------------
+
+GNU Midnight Commander (also referred to as MC) is a user shell with
+text-mode full-screen interface.  It can be run on the OS console,
+in xterm and other terminal emulators.
+
+GNU Midnight Commander allows you to manage files while making most of
+you screen and giving you a clear representation of the filesystem, yet
+it's simple enough to be run over a telnet or ssh session.
+
+GNU Midnight Commander is released under the GNU General Public
+License version 2.0 or any later version.  A copy of the file is
+included with this distribution package.
+
+
+Dependencies
+------------
+
+To compile the GNU Midnight Commander you need to have a copy of the
+glib library version 1.2.x or 2.0.x, available at
+ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/
+
+
+Features
+--------
+
+GNU Midnight Commander was conceived as a free clone of John Socha's
+Norton Commander (TM).  It also takes the best from more recent software
+with similar interfaces.  GNU Midnight Commander comes with mouse support
+on xterm and optionally on the Linux console.
+
+Some features are specific to the POSIX environment MC runs on, some are
+familiar to the users of similar software for other operating systems.
+The features include:
+
+	* Built in Virtual File System: manipulate remote file systems
+          through the FTP and SMB protocols or over secure shell, browse
+          contents of tar, ar, rpm, zip, cpio, lha and rar archives just
+	  like local files.
+
+	* Almost all operations work with the virtual file system,
+	  enabling you to do complex tasks, like viewing files in
+	  archives on an FTP server.
+
+	* Mouse support on most terminal emulators for X Window System
+	  as well as on the Linux console.
+
+	* Learn Keys: GNU Midnight Commander may be configured at run
+	  time to support any kind of input keys for a given terminal,
+	  making its operation possible even on most weird terminals.
+
+	* Text and hex editors are available for you to use (hex editor
+	  is a part of the viewer).
+
+	* Hotlist allows you to keep a list of common visited locations,
+	  including remote sites and directories inside archives.
+
+	* Command completion: By pressing Alt-Tab in any place where a
+	  filename or an executable are expected, GNU Midnight Commander
+	  will complete the name for you.  If you press Alt-Tab for the
+	  second time, you get a list box with all possible completions.
+
+	* Subshell support: Run your commands by a real shell
+	  interpreter.  GNU Midnight Commander interacts with bash,
+	  tcsh and zsh to provide you with all of the facilities
+	  available in your preferred shell.
+
+	* Find file command can search for the file contents.
+
+	* Background operations allow you to copy or move files from
+	  any virtual file system while you do other tasks (i.e., you
+	  can do background FTP copies).
+
+	* FTP proxy is supported.
+
+	* Linux file recovery: If you are using Linux, you can recover
+	  deleted files from an ext2 or ext3 partition with the undelete
+	  file system.  This is a low level file recovery function that
+	  can recover files deleted by any program on Linux.
+
+	* External panelization: You can run any arbitrary external
+	  command and GNU Midnight Commander will display the output
+	  generated as a file listing that can be manipulated as a
+	  regular directory.
+
+	* Emacs-like key bindings are used in all widgets.
+
+	* Context dependent actions (open, view, edit) are available.
+
+	* The built-in file viewer, together with the context dependent
+	  actions is used to format man pages on the fly, coloring mail
+	  messages and more.
+
+	* The built-in editor supports syntax highlighting and external
+	  actions, such as spell checking and formatting.
+
+
+Mini-documentation
+------------------
+
+These are hints for the text mode edition:
+
+* Use the F-Keys for invoking the commands in the function key bar.
+  If your terminal doesn't support F-keys, you can use the <ESC digit>
+  sequence to invoke the corresponding F-digit key.
+
+* Tab changes the current panel.
+
+* All input lines have emacs-like key-bindings (command history is
+  accessed through the M-p and M-n keys).
+
+* The panels accept C-n, C-p for browsing the panel (like in Emacs).
+
+* M-Enter copies the currently selected file name to the input line.
+
+* M-Tab completes the current word (or tries to).
+
+* The Virtual File System is a cute addition to the project, you may
+  browse in tar and compressed tar files as well as browsing remote
+  machines with the mcfs file system.
+
+* Please read the manual page.
+
+* Read the file TODO for the current projects.
+
+You can access the whole documentation online with the F1 key,
+although it's not as nice as the groff printed manual page :-)
+
+
+Where to get more information
+-----------------------------
+
+There is a webpage for GNU Midnight Commander at
+
+http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/
+
+This page also has current information about mailing lists and some
+useful advices how to report bugs.
+
+You can download the latest version of GNU Midnight Commander from
+
+ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mc/
+
+
+Reporting problems
+------------------
+
+There are two mailing lists, mc@gnome.org and mc-devel@gnome.org.  Use
+mc-devel@gnome.org if you are prepared for a more technical discussion
+with the developers of the package, otherwise use mc@gnome.org.
+
+Please don't sent HTML e-mail to either of those mailing lists.
+
+Include the output of "mc --version", the operating system and the
+distribution (if applicable) you are using, the compiler and the
+configure flags used to compile the program (if you know them).
+
+If the program crashed and produced a core dump, please provide a
+stack trace of the program.
+
+You can do this by running gdb like this:
+
+gdb mc core

+Midnight Commander for QNX (not QNX Neutrino)
+---------------------------------------------
+
+1. Compiling
+2. Running 'mc' under QNX
+3. List of modifications on mc-4.1.33
+4. TODO
+5. Contact information
+
+1. Compiling
+------------
+
+1.1 Make utility
+----------------
+
+Use 'gmake'. (This is the default 'make' under QNX 4.23+). [The old 'qmake'
+cannot handle the makefiles in the mc-source.]
+
+1.2 Configuring
+---------------
+
+If you don't have an installed TCP/IP development kit, you have to 'hide'
+the library file 'socket3r.lib' (can be installed by e.g. Watcom C 10.6)
+in /usr/lib or /usr/watcom/10.6/usr/lib, because the existence of this file
+will confuse 'configure': it will erroneously assume you have the complete
+TCP/IP development kit (with headers) and will enable compiling of the
+network-related VFS code (not only tarfs).
+[A patch would be required in the configure-script to check the existence
+of the TCP/IP-related headers also...]
+
+Use '--disable-nls' option, if you don't have the binary utilities of
+GNU 'gettext' package (e.g. 'msgfmt'). ['--with-included-gettext' doesn't
+really work in 4.1.33, there are configuration/compiling problems...]
+
+1.3 Compiler
+------------
+
+It is advised to use Watcom C 10.6+ to compile the source, because older
+compilers (e.g. 9.52) do not support some convenient/required features.
+[e.g. 'ar'-compatible 'wlib',...]
+
+1.4 "No prototype found for '<function>'" warnings
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+It is advised to use high warning level (e.g. 'CFLAGS="-w4" ./configure'),
+when compiling the source, because Watcom C uses a special parameter passing
+convention for functions with fixed number of arguments only. So if the
+compiler doesn't see the correct prototype of a function with variable
+number of arguments (like printf()), it will produce a warning about the
+missing prototype, but generates function call code according to the special
+parameter passing convention, not the required CDECL convention (it is used
+by default for functions with variable number of arguments). So the calling
+convention of the function call code and the function code itself will not
+match! So you MUST provide the correct prototype for function with variable
+number of arguments! (Or you can force using the stack-based calling
+convention as a default, if you have the stack-call-conv version of all of the
+required libraries ('<name>3s.lib')...[Watcom C 10.6 required!])
+
+[The latest release version (4.1.33/qnx) is checked against these types of
+missing prototypes...]
+
+1.5 Tested configuration
+------------------------
+
+QNX 4.24
+Watcom C 10.6 (release version, no newer beta patches)
+Photon 1.12
+no TCP/IP development kit (-> VFS: tarfs only!)
+mc-4.1.33, mc-4.1.34
+
+2. Running 'mc' under QNX
+-------------------------
+
+Using 'qnx*' terminals:
+
+  You cannot use your keyboard correctly, if you disable the "Full 8 bits
+  input" feature in the 'Options|Display bits...' dialog.
+
+  On 'qnx*' terminals 'mc' will run in black and white mode by default,
+  because these types of terminals use non-ANSI-compatible color sequences.
+
+Accessing remote nodes via the native QNX-network:
+
+  [The problem exists under the older versions of 'mc' only...]
+  If directory panels cannot handle '//<node-id>' prefix in directory names,
+  use directory links in order to access remote nodes on the native QNX
+  network:
+
+        mkdir /net
+        ln -sf //1/ /net/1
+        ...
+
+Extension and menu files:
+
+  Default 'tar' uses 'stderr' (and not 'stdout' as its 'normal' output with
+  '-t' option.
+  
+  Default 'tar' is not a GNU 'tar', so does not understand '-z' option.
+
+Special key-mappings:
+
+  Restrictions of the META-? as Alt-? functionality:
+  [META-? as ESC-? will always work!!!]
+
+    Alt-TAB   -> Ctrl-TAB    (Alt-TAB reserved in Photon [1.12+])
+    Alt-ENTER -> Ctrl-ENTER  ('qnx*' terminals only)
+  
+    Alt-<uppercase letter>: doesn't work
+
+'qansi*' terminals:
+
+  Problem [QNX 4.23+ only]: screen corruption (strange line-drawing character
+  set handling) on 'qansi*' terminals, if linked with mc/Slang/terminfo
+  terminal management. (Older versions of QNX and Slang/termcap not affected.)
+
+  This problem is solved, see the comments in slang/sldisply.c about
+  SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH and QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS!
+
+other terminals:
+
+  I have tested 'mc' under QNX on 'qnx*' and 'qansi*' terminals only. 
+  
+toggle panels on/off (CTRL-o):
+
+  Currently not supported, but could be implemented later...
+
+3. List of modifications on mc-4.1.33/mc-4.1.34
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+edit/
+
+ syntax.c: (4.1.33 only, fixed in 4.1.34)
+
+   line 100,191: WCC 10.6 doesn't like "<label>: }" construct ("no statement
+   after the label"), modified to "<label>: /*nop*/; }".
+
+lib/
+
+  mc.menu:
+
+    'Z' on 'tar.Z' and 'tar.z' files: '%f' -> '$1'.
+
+  mc.ext.in.qnx.diff:
+
+    QNX: modified 'mc.ext.in'. [tar -t: output to stderr,...]
+    
+    (No automatic install implemented: patch must be applied before
+    running 'configure' [->mc.ext.in.qnx.diff!]; this patch can be not
+    only QNX-specific...) 
+
+  Makefile.in:
+
+    'mc.ext.in.qnx.diff' added to DISTLIB.
+
+slang/
+
+  sldisply.c:
+
+    SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH dependent code:
+
+    The problem: some terminals (e.g. QNX/qansi*) map the whole upper half of
+    the ASCII table to the lower half, when alt-char-set is activated with
+    the smacs/as string-sequence. This means, that if 0 <= ch < 128 written
+    to the terminal, it will be translated to (ch+128) automatically by the
+    terminal: so not only the line-drawing characters can be written, when
+    the alt-char-set is activated. It implicitly means, that space, NL, CR,
+    etc. characters (exactly: anything besides the "standard" line drawing
+    characters) cannot be written directly to the terminal, when the
+    alt-char-set is activated, because writing these characters doesn't cause
+    an implicit/temporary switching-back to the standard char-set!
+   
+    The original code in SLang assumes that space, NL, CR, etc. can be
+    printed when alt-char-set is activated. If SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH is
+    defined, the modified code will not use this assumption.
+    [Remark: the patch-code is not the most exact solution, but works...]
+
+    QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS_PATCH dependent code:
+
+    A more OS/terminal-specific solution for the problem mentioned above
+    (->SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH).
+  
+    If QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS is defined, the default smacs/sa, rmacs/ae,
+    acsc/ac [and sgr/sa, if it would be used!] command sequences will be
+    replaced internally with the "old style" (pre-QNX 4.23) sequences in case
+    of QNX/qansi terminals. Using these optional command sequences the terminal
+    remains compatible with the original SLang code (without using the
+    workaround-code enabled by defining SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH).
+   
+    Remark:
+
+    Currently SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH is not auto-configured by 'configure'.
+    (Must be manually defined...)
+
+    There is some (QNX-specific) auto-configuration hand-coded in the source:
+
+        #ifdef SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH
+        # if defined(__QNX__) && defined(QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS)
+        #  undef SLTT_TRANSP_ACS_PATCH
+        # endif
+        #else
+        # if defined(__QNX__) && !defined(QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS)
+        #  define QNX_QANSI_SLANG_COMPAT_ACS 1
+        # endif
+        #endif
+
+  slutty.c:
+
+    "newtty.c_iflag &= ~(ECHO | INLCR | ICRNL);"
+
+    ECHO(0x08) is a c_lflag bit, it means PARMRK(0x08) in c_iflag. (!?!)
+
+src/
+
+  file.c:
+
+    'do_reget' can be extern if (USE_VFS && USE_NETCODE), not if (USE_VFS).
+
+  find.c:
+
+    search_content():
+    
+    variable 'i' "must be" 'int', not 'char'. ["i == -1": (buggy?) WCC 10.6
+    doesn't convert automatically (int)(-1) to (char)(-1) (GCC does), so
+    "comparison result always 0" warning produced. It is cleaner to define
+    'i' as 'int', than cast '-1' to 'char', because 'read()' returns 'int'.]
+    
+  key.c:
+
+    init_key():
+
+    Call load_xtra_key_defines() and clear 'use_8th_bit_as_meta' by default
+    under QNX, if a 'qnx*' terminal detected. (A saved config file (mc.ini)
+    can override it later...)
+
+  key.h:
+
+    Declare load_xtra_key_defines().
+
+  keyxdef.c:
+
+    Provides a method to define some platform-specific additional key
+    mappings. (e.g. QNX terminals can handle most of META-? combinations as
+    ALT-?...)
+    
+    (Currently not listed in doc/FILES...)
+
+  layout.c:
+
+    TIOCGWINSZ must be available (<sys/ioctl.h> included), because window-
+    resizing code doesn't work, if not defined.
+
+  main.c:
+
+    print_usage(): reserved name in the QNX run-time library!
+    print_usage() -> print_mc_usage()
+
+  mouse.c:
+
+    QNX: ncurses 1.9.8a ported to QNX doesn't provide the 'SP' pointer as a
+    global symbol in the library, so the keyok() emulation currently cannot
+    be used under QNX (4.24 & Watcom C 10.6 release version).
+
+  slint.c:
+
+    QNX: 'qansi*' terminals added to the color_terminals[] list.
+    
+  subshell.c:
+  utilunix.c:
+
+    QNX: include <unix.h> to get prototype for exec*()!!!
+    [See README.QNX/Section 1.4!]
+    
+  Makefile.in:
+
+    'keyxdef' module added to SRCS and OBJS.
+
+vfs/
+
+  Makefile.in:
+
+    'install' target: 'mcserv' not installed, if net-code not enabled
+    by 'configure'.
+
+<mc-src-root>/
+
+  README.QNX:
+
+    QNX-specific notes...
+  
+  configure (line 3369):
+  configure.in (line 88):
+
+    (mc-4.1.34 only)
+    'test x$CCOPTS = x;' => 'test "x$CCOPTS" = x;'
+
+  Makefile.in:
+
+    README.QNX added to DISTMAIN.
+    
+4. TODO
+-------
+
+Because of limited time and resources now I can define a 'wish list' only:
+(maybe somebody in the QNX community can help...)
+
+subshell support with panel switch on/off ?
+mouse under Photon (with qnxm, qansi-m terminals) ?
+...
+
+5. Contact information

+unnecessary and comment the rest.
+
+Clean up #include's in all files.
+
+Make mc work with 64 bit data types. This includes support for 64 bit
+processors, 64 bit operating systems and 64 bit file sizes. Generalizing
+this, mc should use datatypes as they are appropriate.
+
+Remove all instances of type casts on function pointers. Run the
+following command to get a list of function pointer types.
+    grep -r 'typedef.*(\*' . \
+    | sed -n 's/.*(\*\([[:alnum:]_]*\)).*/(\1)/p' \
+    | sort -u \
+    > fn-types.txt
+Then use fgrep to find illegal uses of these types.
+    fgrep -r "`cat fn-types.txt`" .
+Fix these uses by writing small wrapper functions.
+
+When saving a file is not possible, mcedit should ask the user what to
+do:
+- su(1) to another user and try again
+- sudo
+- change permissions of the file or the containg directory
+- other smart things
+
+Due to problems in the VFS, files are not written back after being edited
+over VFS with an external editor.
+
+Allow pathnames starting with spaces in vfs/extfs.
+
+Hide the passwords when displaying mcvfs path names.
+
+Broken pipe warning when viewing large *.tar.gz files.  Warnings should
+be shown before the viewer is started if possible.
+
+Cannot spell check unsaved files in the editor.
+
+Dynamic loading for libgpm, libext2fs.
+
+Check if the archive was changed for extfs, tar and cpio.  Free the data
+associated with the old archive.
+
+Use Del to remove items from history.
+
+Ctrl-q Ctrl-m in input dialog should enter \r, not a newline.
+
+Interpret C literals in regular expressions entered by the user, e.g. \r
+and \0x0D.
+
+Allow entering archives in VFS by Ctrl-PgDown with non-empty command
+line.  Right now, there is no convenient way to enter an archive when
+the command line is not empty.
+
+Allow switching between histories of two panels.  It's convenient to
+change to a directory from the history of the other panel.
+
+Allow calling the directory hotlist from Copy, Move and Find File
+dialogs.  Recent directories are the obvious candidates for copying and
+looking for files.
+
+Allow modifiers for keys in mc.lib, like "shift-up".  Right now,
+modifiers can be read from the terminal (if supported), but not from the
+config file.  This change would make it possible to use modifiers even
+if they can only be identified by the escape sequences.
+
+When saving config files, write to a copy, then replace the file.  This
+would avoid the problem of partly written config files.  Consider using
+locking of the config files.
+
+Totals are not calculated when copying or moving a single directory. 
+Totals should only be omitted for single files.
+
+Recheck all mouse handlers, make sure that they check button number.  We
+don't want mouse scrolling to be interpreted as mouse click.
+
+Smooth mouse scrolling on panels.  Scrolling one page per step is too
+fast.
+
+Don't read prompt from the subshell, because it's unreliable.  Interpret
+environment variable MC_PS1 (or PS1) in the same way as bash.
+
+Support an environment variable (also like PS1 in bash) for setting the
+window title.
+
+real_input_dialog_help() shouldn't use translated strings in the section
+names in .mc/history.  Right now, mc writes separate history sections
+for different locales.  Only input history is affected.
+
+Add "Ignore" and "Ignore all" buttons when reporting permission
+problems.
+
+Better date parser - don't allow seconds and year in ftp listings on the
+same line.
+
+Report errors in fish operations and recover from them.
+
+Allow colors to be defined in the mc.lib file.  Make it possible to
+avoid using a super-long line to redefine all colors.
+
+Allow verbatim search in "Find File".  Right now, the context is always
+interpreted as regular expression.
+
+Filters in the editor should operate on the open file - don't close and
+reopen the file.  They don't work on VFS now.  For example, a gzipped
+files on FTP cannot be edited.
+
+ftp and fish with home != '/' - readjust directory to the home.
+
+Search in the viewer should have an option for case sensitive search.
+
+Make "Find File" dialog more responsive.  Keep state in a structure and
+preserve it when the search is suspended.
+
+Use KDGKBENT ioctl on Linux console to find the mapping for shifted
+functional keys.  Two mappings are widely used (Shift-F1 = F11 and
+Shift-F1 = F13).  mc should adjust the keys to the mapping.
+
+Alt-O should optionally show the current directory and move cursor down
+(as in older versions).  Old functionality on files (go to "..") is not
+needed.
+
+
+After 4.6.2 on 4.6.x branch
+===========================
+
+Make the internal editor reentrant.  Add "edit menu file" to the editor
+menu.
+
+Safe and restore file position in the viewer.
+
+Consistent support for mc.lib.
+
+Consistent support for terminal-specific settings.
+
+New syntax for mc.ext - path check, desktop environment check.  Detach X
+programs into a separate process group.  Allow forcing the full path on
+local files.
+
+Click on an image doesn't always work on remote vfs - local copy may
+be deleted before the application has time to load it.
+
+Allow running executables from remote VFS.  Possibly warn the user.
+
+Add print dialog in the internal editor.
+
+Implement logging, not just for VFS.
+
+"Find file" should remember full starting path, not "." in the history.
+
+
+In the 4.7 branch
+=================
+
+Eliminate all pipes in subshell.c, run pwd after kill.  Add support for
+more shells (e.g. ksh).
+
+Internal terminal - no more console saving.
+
+Implement a really Advanced Chown/Chmod.
+
+Support for multi-byte charsets (e.g. UTF-8).
+
+sftp and fxp support in VFS.
+
+New listing mode keyword "time": mtime or the time (atime, ctime) used
+to sort files.
+
+Support for X clipboard.
+
+Provide "patch" and "diff" editors. The patch editor will automatically
+adjust the line numbers of the following chunks when lines are deleted
+or inserted at the beginning of the file.
+
+Provide context menus for files. Possible actions include: [compile],
+[CVS commit], [CVS diff -up], [pack], [unpack], [grep].
+
+Make mc a CVS frontend comparable to Eclipse-3.0.
+
+More standard Widgets: WTreeView, WDirectoryList, WGroupBox, WTextArea,
+WOpenDialog, WSaveDialog, WPrintDialog, WKeyBar.
+
+========================================================================
+Everything below this point is the old TODO list.  It doesn't reflect
+the current priorities of the developers, but may contain interesting
+ideas still waiting for their implementation.
+========================================================================
+
+
+* Bugs
+
+  - "Files" message flickers a lot when copying files.
+
+  - Make the extfs handle re-reads.
+
+  - Document (or remove) C-x C-r, C-x C-s.
+
+  - Check that all the help contexts exist on the help file.
+
+  - Make the buttonbar for the tree box work.
+
+  - In the incremental search mode, when backspacing, select the
+    correct file, do not stop in current file.
+
+  - Make C-y yank back all the killed text at once if you've just done
+    several kill operations in a row (C-k, M-d, etc).
+
+  - In learn keys, warn the user if he is trying to
+    i) define a same sequence as an already defined (if the keycode differs)
+    ii) define a sequence, which is a prefix of other longer and already
+        defined sequence
+
+* Configuration 
+
+* Documentation
+
+  - Convert the source mc.1 to mc.sgml and create automagically from it
+    mc.1, mc.html, mc.hlp, mc.info, mc.tex, mc.txt etc.
+
+* Extensions
+
+   - Hotlist should allow people to edit the entry (like we do in the external
+     panelize thing).
+
+   - Change ext.c to allow the %{..} to recursively expand any other %thingies.
+
+   - Write a general grow_string routine.  This code is used in the internal
+     viewer and would also be used in the profile.c code.
+
+   -  A command to set the line length to a fixed value for viewing
+      fixed length binary files. LIST does this with Ctrl-B and then
+      prompts for a "record" length.
+
+   - Viewer: Mark all found matches, and when 'n' is pressed go to the
+     next page, not the next match on the same screen (when there is
+     more than one).
+
+  - In ftpfs_open, extfs_open, if we set local_filename to tmpnam, use
+    a mechanism to set local_filename to another place on the local
+    diskspace (this would be useful for copying, so that we would save
+    some tmp space). This would require special care in file.c afterwards.
+
+  - In Listing mode... give at least three user-definable formats
+    (using Janne's Listing mode editor) and assign hot-keys to both
+    standard and user defined (what about c-x f [fbl123] ?).
+
+  - Shift-Home, Shift-End for the input line: home and end.
+
+  - Make a mechanism to lock all the mouse events and send them to
+    the locking widget until unlocking is done.
+
+  - Sort with numerical extensions.
+
+  - Allow the program to execute a command even when we are on a vfs, maybe
+    a special box, or make subshell code ignore the change directory
+    request. Perhaps each vfs should store a local path attached to it,
+    like in tarfs, extfs it would be the directory which contains the
+    topmost tararchive, in ftpfs it would be the directory which we entered
+    to ftp from.
+
+  - auto_hint_lines: a variable that would choose to use hint mode when
+    at least auto_hint_lines are visible.
+
+  - Listbox: Mouse handler for the scrollbar: this will be hard with
+    the current approach (since the listbox scrollbar is drawn *outside*
+    the listbox control area).
+
+  - In file.c, we shouldn't need to get a full path name in order to
+    work, we should instead canon the file name inside the tar.c (the
+    only fs that relies on this), tar.c should know about the cwd (i
+    think).
+
+  - Panelize the selected files.
+
+  - Recursive delete should (perhaps as an option) delete files just after
+    they have been copied and not to delay deleting until everything was
+    moved.
+
+  - When copying a tree (or moving or deleting), as an option act primarily
+    on the regular files and at the end on directories recursively, so that
+    we get complete high parts of the tree if something fails (useful for
+    ftpfs).
+
+  - Put into a new and bigger Options/Configuration dialog all the options
+    we have now to set using .mc/ini manually.
+
+  - When after deleting there are no files in a panelized panel, restore
+    it automagically to the real directory content.
+
+  - Files/Symlink and Link should be able to do multiple links (if the
+    target is a directory).
+
+  - Directory sizes should work in background using try_channels.
+
+  - Support of non-UNIX ls in ftpfs. Perhaps using an ascii configuration
+    file similar to moxftp.
+
+  - Have an option to let the user choose the preferred keybindings.
+    Currently, only the emacs keybindings are supported, add support
+    for Norton Commander and vi keybindings.
+
+  - Find command should have a way to specify directories to skip.
+
+  - Add an option that will let listboxes do incremental searches.
+
+* Optimizations and cleanup
+
+  - Optimize the mcfs read and write code: make the code output 8k
+    blocks all the time (if we have called mc_hint_readall) and probe
+    the input for a possible cancel.
+
+  - When verbose is off, remove all the clutter on the screen about
+    the files being copied.
+
+  - The viewer is calling view_update in many places, I call
+    view_update after handling a key, should all the other
+    view_updates be removed?
+
+  - If the viewer is too slow, some caching could be done.
+    width and cols are currently computed each time they are needed.
+
+ ++ In the user menu, don't use the entries array, we can now grow
+    dynamically.  I should take a look at this one day, it's easy to
+    fix.

-.\"NODE "Overview"
-.SH "Introduccin"
-La pantalla de Midnight Commander est divida en cuatro partes. La mayor
-parte de la pantalla est ocupada por los dos paneles de directorio. Por defecto,
-la segunda lnea ms inferior de la pantalla es la lnea de rdenes del sistema, y
-la lnea inferior muestra las etiquetas de las teclas de funcin. La lnea superior es la
-.\"LINK2"
-barra de men\&.
-.\"Menu Bar"
-La lnea de la barra de men podra no ser visible, pero aparece si pulsamos
-en la primea lnea de la pantalla con el ratn o pulsamos la tecla F9.
-.PP
-Midnight Commander pone a la vista dos directorios al mismo
-tiempo. Uno de los paneles es el panel actual (hay una barra de seleccin
-en el panel actual). La mayora de las operaciones tienen lugar en el
-panel actual. Algunas operaciones con archivos como Renombrar y Copiar utilizan
-por defecto el directorio del panel no seleccionado como destino, pero
-siempre solicitan una confirmacin previa y podemos cambiarlo. Para ms
-informacin, ver las secciones sobre los
-.\"LINK2"
-Paneles de Directorio\&,

-.\"NODE "Mouse Support"
-.SH "Soporte de Ratn"
-Midnight Commander soporta el uso del ratn. Se activa cuando
-estamos ejecutndolo en un terminal tipo
-.B xterm(1)
-(funciona incluso si realizamos una conexin de telnet, ssh o rlogin a
-otra mquina desde el xterm) o si estamos ejecutndolo en una consola Linux
-y tenemos el servidor
-.B gpm
-cargado.
-.PP
-Cuando pulsamos el botn izquierdo del ratn sobre un archivo en los paneles
-de directorios, ese archivo es seleccionado; si lo hacemos con el botn derecho,
-el archivo es marcado (o desmarcado, dependiendo del estado previo).
-.PP
-Una doble pulsacin sobre un archivo intentar ejecutar el comando si se trata de
-un programa ejecutable; y si la extensin del archivo tiene un programa

-asociado a esa extensin\&,
-.\"Extension File Edit"
-se ejecuta el programa especificado.
-.PP
-Adems, es posible ejecutar los comandos asignados a las teclas de funcin
-pulsando con el ratn sobre las etiquetas de la lnea inferior de la pantalla.
-.PP
-Si se pulsa un botn del ratn sobre la lnea del borde superior del

-.\"NODE "Keys"
-.SH "Teclas"
-Algunos comandos en Midnight Commander implican el uso de las teclas
-.I Control
-(etiquetada habitualmente CTRL o CTL) y
-.I Meta
-(identificada como ALT o incluso Compose). En este manual usaremos las
-siguientes abreviaturas:
-.TP
-.B Ctrl-<car>
-significa mantener pulsada la tecla Control mientras se pulsa el carcter
-<car>. As, Ctrl-f sera: manteniendo pulsada la tecla Control teclear f.

-.PP
-Cuando se selecciona una opcin todas las lneas de comandos de esa

-  t <tipo>		archivo actual es de tipo <tipo>?
-  T <tipo>		otro archivo es de tipo <tipo>?
-  ! <sub-cond>		niega el resultado de la sub-condicin
-.fi
-.PP
-Patrn es un patrn normal del shell o una expresin regular, de acuerdo
-con la opcin de patrones del shell. Podemos cambiar el valor global de
-la opcin de los patrones del shell escribiendo "shell_patterns=x" en la primera lnea
-del archivo de men (donde "x" es 0  1).
-.PP
-Tipo es uno o ms de los siguientes caracteres:
-.PP
-.nf
-  n	no directorio
-  r	archivo regular
-  d	directorio
-  l	enlace

-  b	dispositivo tipo bloque
-  f	tubera (fifo)

-.PP
-Por ejemplo 'rlf' significa archivo regular, enlace o cola. El tipo 't'

-un archivo. La condicin '=t t' es verdadera si existen archivos marcados en el
-panel actual y falsa si no los hay.
-.PP
-Si la condicin comienza con '=?' en vez de '=' se mostrar un trazado de
-depuracin mientras el valor de la condicin es calculado.
-.PP
-Las condiciones son calculadas de izquierda a derecha. Esto significa que
-.nf
-	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
-.fi
-es calculado como

-	gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -
-.fi
-.PP
-.B Condiciones aditivas
-.PP
-Si la condicin comienza con '+' (o '+?') en lugar de '=' (o '=?') es
-una condicin aditiva. Si la condicin es verdadera la entrada de men ser
-incluida en el men. Sin embargo, si la condicin es falsa, la entrada de men no ser
-incluida en el men.
-.PP
-Podemos combinar condiciones por defecto y aditivas comenzando la condicin con
-'+=' o '=+' (o '+=?' o '=+?' si queremos depurar). Si nosotros queremos
-condiciones diferentes, una para aadir y otra por
-defecto, una entrada de men con dos lneas de condicin, una
-comenzando con '+' y otra con '='.
-.PP
-Los comentarios empiezan con '#'. Las lneas adicionales de comentarios deben empezar
-con '#', espacio o tabulacin.

-(y enlaces a directorios) aparecen al principio de la lista, y el resto
-de archivos a continuacin.
-.PP
-.I Recarga Rpida de Directorios.
-Hace que Midnight Commander emplee una pequea trampa al determinar
-si los contenidos del directorio han cambiado. El truco consiste en
-recargar el directorio slo si el inodo del directorio ha cambiado. Las
-recargas se producen si se crean o borrar archivos, pero si lo que cambia
-es slo el inodo de un archivo del directorio (cambios en el tamao,
-permisos, propietario, etc.) la pantalla no se actualiza. En esos casos,
-si tenemos la opcin activada, ser preciso forzar la recarga de forma
-manual (con Ctrl-r).
-.PP
-.B Pausa Despus de Ejecutar.
-.PP
-Despus de ejecutar comandos, Midnight Commander puede realizar una pausa,
-y darnos tiempo a examinar la salida del comando. Hay tres posibles
-valores para esta variable:

-la operacin detallada. Se desactiva automticamente si la velocidad de
-nuestro terminal es menor de 9600 bps.
-.PP
-.I Calcular Totales.
-Hace que Midnight Commander calcule el total de bytes y el nmero de
-archivos antes de iniciar operaciones de Copiar, Mover y Borrar. Esto
-proporciona una barra de progreso ms precisa a costa de cierta
-velocidad. Esta opcin no tiene efecto si la
-.I Operacin Detallada
-no est seleccionada.
-.PP
-.I Patrones del shell.
-Por defecto, las funciones Seleccin, Deseleccin y Filtro emplean
-expresiones regulares al estilo del shell. Para realizar esto se
-realizan las siguientes conversiones: '*' se cambia por '.*' (cero o

-Esta opcin, si est seleccionada, hace que Midnight Commander siga la
-secuencia de directorios lgica al cambiar el directorio actual, tanto en
-el panel como usando el comando cd. ste es el comportamiento por defecto
-de la shell bash. Sin esto, Midnight Commander sigue la estructura real
-de directorios, y cd .. nos trasladar al padre real del directorio
-actual aunque hayamos entrado en ese directorio a travs de un enlace,
-y no al directorio donde se encontraba el enlace.
-.PP
-.I Precauciones de Borrado.
-Dificulta el borrado accidental de archivos. La opcin por defecto en el
-dilogo de confirmacin de borrado se cambia a "No". Por defecto, esta
-opcin est desactivada.

-Este dilogo nos permite comprobar si nuestras teclas F1-F20, Inicio, Fin, etc. funcionan adecuadamente
-en nuestro terminal. A menudo fallan, dado que muchas bases de datos de terminales estn mal.
-.PP
-Podemos movernos alrededor con la tecla Tab, con las teclas de movimiento de vi ('h' izquierda, 'j'
-abajo, 'k' arriba y 'l' derecha) y despus de pulsar cualquier tecla del cursor (esto
-las marcar con OK), entonces podremos usar esa tecla tambin.
-.PP
-Para probarlas basta con pulsar cada una de ellas. Tan pronto como pulsamos una tecla y
-sta funciona adecuadamente, OK debera aparecer junto al nombre de la susodicha tecla. Una vez
-que una tecla es marcada con OK empieza a funcionar con normalidad, p.e. F1 la primera vez
-comprobar que F1 funciona perfectamente, pero a partir de ese momento mostrar la ayuda.
-Esto mismo es aplicable a las teclas del cursor. La tecla Tab debera funcionar siempre.
-.PP
-Si algunas teclas no funcionan adecuadamente, entonces no veremos el OK tras el nombre de la tecla
-despus de haberla pulsado. Podemos entonces intentar solucionarlo. Haremos esto

-.PP
-Cuando la opcin de Patrones Shell est desactivada MC no realiza una

-origen para especificar el significado de los comodines en la mscara destino.
-Esto es ms flexible pero tambin necesita ms escritura. Por lo dems,
-las mscaras destino son similares al caso de Patrones Shell activos.
-.PP
-Dos ejemplos:
-.PP
-Si la mscara de origen es "^\\(.*\\)\\.tar\\.gz$", el destino es

-.RI ' "cd #nombrefs" '
-donde nombrefs es el nombre corto que identifica el extfs (ver ms
-adelante).  Ejemplos de stos son audio (lista de pistas de sonido en

-.PP
-Por ejemplo, para listar las pistas de msica del CD, escribir
-.PP
-.nf
-  cd #audio
-.fi
-.PP
-2. Sistemas de archivos en un archivo (como rpm, patchfs y ms), que
-muestran los contenidos de un archivo en forma de rbol de directorios.
-Puede tratarse de archivos reales empaquetados o comprimidos en un archivo
-(urar, rpm) o archivos virtuales, como puede ser el caso de mensajes
-en un archivo de correo electrnico (mailfs) o partes de un archivo de
-modificaciones o parches (patchfs). Para acceder a ellos se aade
-.RI ' #nombrefs '
-al nombre del archivo a abrir. Este archivo podra l mismo estar en
-otro sistema de archivos virtual.
-.PP
-Por ejemplo, para listar los contenidos de un archivo documentos.zip

-.PP
-Si pu prendere in considerazione l'uso del comando
-.\"LINK2"
-pannellizza comando
-.\"External panelize"
-per operazioni particolari. Il comando trova file serve solo per 
-ricerche semplici mentre usando pannellizza comando si pu fare 
-ricerche complesse come si vuole.
-.\"NODE "    External panelize"
-.SH "    Pannellizza comando"
-Pannellizza comando permette di eseguire un programma esterno, e
-mettere il risultato del programma nel pannello corrente.
-.PP
-Per esempio, se si vuole manipolare in uno dei pannelli tutti i collegamenti
-simbolici nella directory corrente, basta usare pannellizza comando per
-eseguire il seguente:
-.PP
-.nf
-find . -type l -print
-.fi
-.PP
-Al completamento del comando, il contenuto del pannello non sar pi
-il listato della directory ma tutti i file che rappresentano
-collegamenti simbolici.
-.PP
-Volendo pannellizzare tutti i file che sono stati scaricati dal
-proprio server ftp preferito, si pu usare questo comando awk per
-estrarre il nome del file dal file di log del traferimento:
-.PP
-.nf
-awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /usr/adm/xferlog
-.fi
-.PP
-Se si desidera si pu salvare i comandi di pannellizzazione usati pi 
-spesso con uno nome pi descrittivo, in maniera da richiamarli pi velocemente.
-Per fare ci basta battere il comando sulla riga di ingresso e premere il tasto
-Aggiungi nuovo. Poi si deve dare un nome al quale associare il comando che si
-desidera salvare. La prossima volta sar possibile scegliere quel comando 
-dall'elenco e non servir ribatterlo nuovamente.
-.\"NODE "    Hotlist"
-.SH "    Directory favorite"
-Il comando Directory favorite mostra le etichette delle directory nell'elenco
-delle favorite. Il Midnight Commander andr alla directory corrispondente
-all'etichetta selezionata. Dalla finestra delle favorite si possono rimuovere
-etichette/directory gi create ed aggiungerne di nuove. Per aggiungere 
-velocemente nuove directory basta usare il comando Aggiungi alle favorite 
-(C-x h), che aggiunge la directory corrente alla lista delle favorite,
-richiedendo l'etichetta per identificarla.
-.PP
-Questo rende pi veloce il cd verso directory usate spesso. Considera l'uso della
-variabile CDPATH come descritto in
-.\"LINK2"
-comando cd interno\&.
-.\"The cd internal command"
-.\"NODE "    Extension File Edit"

-a tutti. Se tale file non viene trovato, mc alla stessa maniera 
-prova con ~/.mc/menu altrimenti usa il menu di sistema
-@prefix@/share/mc/mc.menu.
-.PP
-Il formato del file menu  molto semplice. Le righe che cominciano
-con qualsiasi cosa che non sia uno spazio o una tabulazione sono
-considerate voci per il menu (per fare in modo di usarle anche come
-scelta rapida, il primo carattere deve essere una lettera). Tutte le
-righe che cominciano con uno spazio o un tab sono i comandi che verranno
-eseguiti quando la voce viene selezionata.
-.PP
-Quando un'opzione viene selezionata tutte le linee di comando dell'opzione
-vengono copiate in un file temporaneo nella directory temporanea (normalmente
-/usr/tmp) e poi il file viene eseguito. Ci permette all'utente di mettere
-normali costrutti shell nei menu. Prima dell'esecuzione del codice del menu
-ha luogo una semplice sostituzione di macro. Per ulteriori informazioni vedere

+.\"NODE "Overview"
+.SH "Introduccin"
+La pantalla de Midnight Commander est divida en cuatro partes. La mayor
+parte de la pantalla est ocupada por los dos paneles de directorio. Por defecto,
+la segunda lnea ms inferior de la pantalla es la lnea de rdenes del sistema, y
+la lnea inferior muestra las etiquetas de las teclas de funcin. La lnea superior es la
+.\"LINK2"
+barra de men\&.
+.\"Menu Bar"
+La lnea de la barra de men podra no ser visible, pero aparece si pulsamos
+en la primea lnea de la pantalla con el ratn o pulsamos la tecla F9.
+.PP
+Midnight Commander pone a la vista dos directorios al mismo
+tiempo. Uno de los paneles es el panel actual (hay una barra de seleccin
+en el panel actual). La mayora de las operaciones tienen lugar en el
+panel actual. Algunas operaciones con archivos como Renombrar y Copiar utilizan
+por defecto el directorio del panel no seleccionado como destino, pero
+siempre solicitan una confirmacin previa y podemos cambiarlo. Para ms
+informacin, ver las secciones sobre los
+.\"LINK2"
+Paneles de Directorio\&,
+.\"Directory Panels"
+los
+.\"LINK2"
+Mens Izquierdo y Derecho
+.\"Left and Right Menus"
+y el
+.\"LINK2"
+Men de Archivo\&.
+.\"File Menu"
+.PP
+Podemos ejecutar comandos del sistema desde el Midnight Commander simplemente
+escribindolos. Todo lo que escribamos aparecer en la lnea de rdenes del sistema
+y cuando pulsemos 
+.IR Intro ,
+Midnight Commander ejecutar estos comandos; ver las secciones
+.\"LINK2"
+Lnea de rdenes del Sistema
+.\"Shell Command Line"
+y
+.\"LINK2"
+Teclas de la Lnea de Entrada
+.\"Input Line Keys"
+para aprender ms sobre la lnea de rdenes.
+.\"NODE "Mouse Support"
+.SH "Soporte de Ratn"
+Midnight Commander soporta el uso del ratn. Se activa cuando
+estamos ejecutndolo en un terminal tipo
+.B xterm(1)
+(funciona incluso si realizamos una conexin de telnet, ssh o rlogin a
+otra mquina desde el xterm) o si estamos ejecutndolo en una consola Linux
+y tenemos el servidor
+.B gpm
+cargado.
+.PP
+Cuando pulsamos el botn izquierdo del ratn sobre un archivo en los paneles
+de directorios, ese archivo es seleccionado; si lo hacemos con el botn derecho,
+el archivo es marcado (o desmarcado, dependiendo del estado previo).
+.PP
+Una doble pulsacin sobre un archivo intentar ejecutar el comando si se trata de
+un programa ejecutable; y si la extensin del archivo tiene un programa
+.\"LINK2"
+asociado a esa extensin\&,
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+se ejecuta el programa especificado.
+.PP
+Adems, es posible ejecutar los comandos asignados a las teclas de funcin
+pulsando con el ratn sobre las etiquetas de la lnea inferior de la pantalla.
+.PP
+Si se pulsa un botn del ratn sobre la lnea del borde superior del
+panel de directorio, se sube una pgina hacia atrs. Asimismo, una pulsacin
+sobre la lnea inferior baja una pgina hacia adelante. ste
+procedimiento vale tambin para el
+.\"LINK2"
+Visor de Ayuda
+.\"Contents"
+y el
+.\"LINK2"
+rbol de Directorios\&.
+.\"Directory Tree"
+.PP
+El valor por defecto de auto repeticin para los botones del ratn es 400
+milisegundos. Este valor se puede modificar editando el archivo
+.\"LINK2"
+\&~/.mc/ini
+.\"Save Setup"
+y cambiando el parmetro
+.IR mouse_repeat_rate .
+.PP
+Si estamos ejecutando Midnight Commander con soporte para ratn, podemos
+recuperar el comportamiento habitual del ratn (cortar y pegar texto)
+manteniendo pulsada la tecla Maysculas.
+.SH ""
+.\"NODE "Keys"
+.SH "Teclas"
+Algunos comandos en Midnight Commander implican el uso de las teclas
+.I Control
+(etiquetada habitualmente CTRL o CTL) y
+.I Meta
+(identificada como ALT o incluso Compose). En este manual usaremos las
+siguientes abreviaturas:
+.TP
+.B Ctrl-<car>
+significa mantener pulsada la tecla Control mientras se pulsa el carcter
+<car>. As, Ctrl-f sera: manteniendo pulsada la tecla Control teclear f.
+.TP
+.B Alt-<car>
+significa mantener pulsada la tecla Alt o Meta mientras pulsamos el
+carcter <car>. Si no hay tecla Alt ni Meta, pulsar
+.IR Esc ,
+soltar, y entonces pulsar el carcter <car>.
+.TP
+.B Mays-<car>
+significa mantener pulsada la tecla de Maysculas (o Shift) y teclear
+<car>.
+.PP
+Todas las lneas de entrada en Midnight Commander usan una aproximacin
+a las asociaciones de teclas del editor GNU Emacs.
+.PP
+Hay bastantes secciones que hablan acerca de las teclas. Las siguientes
+son las ms importantes.
+.PP
+La seccin
+.\"LINK2"
+Men de Archivo
+.\"File Menu"
+documenta los atajos de teclado para los comandos que aparecen en
+el Men de Archivo. Esta seccin incluye las teclas de funcin. La mayor parte
+de esos comandos realizan alguna accin, normalmente sobre el archivo seleccionado
+o sobre los archivos marcados.
+.PP
+La seccin
+.\"LINK2"
+Paneles de Directorio
+.\"Directory Panels"
+documenta las teclas que seleccionan un archivo o marcan archivos como
+objetivo de una accin posterior (la accin normalmente es una del
+men de archivo).
+.PP
+La seccin
+.\"LINK2"
+Lnea de rdenes del Sistema
+.\"Shell Command Line"
+lista las teclas que son usadas para introducir o editar lneas de
+comandos. La mayor parte de ellas copian nombres de archivos y dems desde
+los paneles de directorio a la lnea de rdenes (para evitar un tecleado excesivo)
+o acceden al historial de la lnea de rdenes.
+.PP
+.\"LINK2"
+Teclas de lnea de Entrada
+.\"Input Line Keys"
+Son usadas para editar lneas de entrada. Esto implica la lnea de rdenes
+y las lneas de entrada en las ventanas de preguntas.
+.\"NODE "  Miscellaneous Keys"

+.PP
+.B Intro.
+Si hay algn texto en la lnea de rdenes (la de la parte inferior de
+los paneles), entonces ese comando es ejecutado. Si no hay texto en la lnea
+de comandos entonces si la barra de seleccin est situada sobre un directorio
+Midnight Commander realiza un
+.B chdir(2)
+al directorio seleccionado y recarga la informacin en el panel;
+si la seleccin es un archivo ejecutable entonces es ejecutado. Por ltimo,
+si la extensin del archivo seleccionado coincide con una de las

+estn deshabilitados, entonces la seleccin de archivos se realiza con expresiones
+regulares normales. Vase la pgina de manual de
+.BR "ed (1)" .
+.IP
+Si la expresin empieza o termina con una barra (/), entonces la seleccin se
+realiza sobre directorios en vez de archivos.
+.TP
+.B - (menos) o \\\\ (contrabarra)
+usaremos la tecla - o "\\" para deseleccionar un grupo de archivos. sta es la operacin contraria
+a la realizada por la tecla Ms (+).

+  T <tipo>		otro archivo es de tipo <tipo>?
+  ! <sub-cond>		niega el resultado de la sub-condicin
+.fi
+.PP
+Patrn es un patrn normal del shell o una expresin regular, de acuerdo
+con la opcin de patrones del shell. Podemos cambiar el valor global de
+la opcin de los patrones del shell escribiendo "shell_patterns=x" en la primera lnea
+del archivo de men (donde "x" es 0  1).
+.PP
+Tipo es uno o ms de los siguientes caracteres:

+Si la condicin comienza con '+' (o '+?') en lugar de '=' (o '=?') es
+una condicin aditiva. Si la condicin es verdadera la entrada de men ser
+incluida en el men. Sin embargo, si la condicin es falsa, la entrada de men no ser
+incluida en el men.
+.PP
+Podemos combinar condiciones por defecto y aditivas comenzando la condicin con
+'+=' o '=+' (o '+=?' o '=+?' si queremos depurar). Si nosotros queremos
+condiciones diferentes, una para aadir y otra por
+defecto, una entrada de men con dos lneas de condicin, una
+comenzando con '+' y otra con '='.

+Opciones de los Paneles, Pausa Despus de Ejecutar y Otras Opciones.
+.PP
+.B Opciones de los paneles
+.PP
+.I Mostrar Archivos de Respaldo.
+Mostrar los archivos terminados en tilde '~'. Por defecto, Midnight
+Commander no los muestra (como la opcin -B de ls de GNU).
+.PP
+.I Mostrar Archivos Ocultos.
+Mostrar los archivos que comiencen con un punto (como ls -a).
+.PP
+.I Marcar y Avanzar.
+Hacer avanzar la barra de seleccin tras marcar un archivo (con Ctrl-t o
+con la tecla Insertar).
+.PP
+.I Mens Desplegables.
+Mostrar el contenido de los mens desplegables inmediatamente al presionar
+F9. Si est desactivada slo la barra de ttulos de los mens est

+o con las teclas de acceso rpido.
+.PP
+.I Mezclar Archivos y Directorios.
+Cuando esta opcin est habilitada, todos los archivos y directorios
+se muestran mezclados. Si la opcin est desactivada, los directorios
+(y enlaces a directorios) aparecen al principio de la lista, y el resto
+de archivos a continuacin.
+.PP
+.I Recarga Rpida de Directorios.
+Hace que Midnight Commander emplee una pequea trampa al determinar
+si los contenidos del directorio han cambiado. El truco consiste en
+recargar el directorio slo si el inodo del directorio ha cambiado. Las
+recargas se producen si se crean o borrar archivos, pero si lo que cambia
+es slo el inodo de un archivo del directorio (cambios en el tamao,
+permisos, propietario, etc.) la pantalla no se actualiza. En esos casos,
+si tenemos la opcin activada, ser preciso forzar la recarga de forma
+manual (con Ctrl-r).
+.PP
+.B Pausa Despus de Ejecutar.
+.PP
+Despus de ejecutar comandos, Midnight Commander puede realizar una pausa,
+y darnos tiempo a examinar la salida del comando. Hay tres posibles
+valores para esta variable:
+.PP
+.I Nunca.
+Significa que no queremos ver la salida de nuestros comandos. Si estamos
+utilizando la consola Linux o FreeBSD o un xterm, podremos ver la salida
+del comando pulsando
+.IR Ctrl-o .
+.PP
+.I Slo en Terminales Tontas.
+Obtendremos el mensaje de pausa slo en terminales que no sean capaces
+de mostrar la salida del ltimo comando ejecutado (en realidad, cualquier
+terminal que no sea un xterm o una consola de Linux).
+.PP
+.I Siempre.
+El programa realizar siempre una pausa despus de ejecutar comandos.
+.PP
+.B Otras Opciones
+.PP
+.I Operacin Detallada.
+Controla la visualizacin de detalles durante las operaciones de
+Copiar, Mover y Borrar (i.e., muestra un cuadro de dilogo para cada
+operacin). Si tenemos un terminal lento, podramos querer desactivar
+la operacin detallada. Se desactiva automticamente si la velocidad de
+nuestro terminal es menor de 9600 bps.
+.PP
+.I Calcular Totales.
+Hace que Midnight Commander calcule el total de bytes y el nmero de
+archivos antes de iniciar operaciones de Copiar, Mover y Borrar. Esto
+proporciona una barra de progreso ms precisa a costa de cierta
+velocidad. Esta opcin no tiene efecto si la
+.I Operacin Detallada
+no est seleccionada.
+.PP
+.I Patrones del shell.
+Por defecto, las funciones Seleccin, Deseleccin y Filtro emplean
+expresiones regulares al estilo del shell. Para realizar esto se
+realizan las siguientes conversiones: '*' se cambia por '.*' (cero o
+ms caracteres); '?' por '.' (exactamente un carcter) y '.' por un
+punto literal. Si la opcin est desactivada, entonces las expresiones
+regulares son las descritas en ed(1).

+y si no se especifica ninguno, se usar
+.B vi.
+Vase la seccin sobre el
+.\"LINK2"
+editor de archivos interno\&.
+.\"Internal File Editor"
+.PP
+.I Usar Visor Interno.
+Emplear el visor de archivos interno. Si la opcin est desactivada,
+el paginador especificado en la variable de entorno
+.B PAGER
+ser el utilizado.
+Si no se especifica ninguno, se usar el comando
+.B view.
+Vase la seccin sobre el
+.\"LINK2"
+visor de archivos interno\&.
+.\"Internal File Viewer"
+.PP
+.I Completar: Mostrar Todos.
+Por defecto, al completar nombres en situaciones de ambigedad, Midnight
+Commander completa todo lo posible al pulsar
+.B Alt-Tab
+y produce un pitido; al intentarlo por segunda vez se muestra una lista
+con las posibilidades que han dado lugar a la ambigedad. Con esta opcin,
+la lista aparece directamente tras pulsar
+.B Alt-Tab
+por primera vez.
+.PP
+.I Hlice de actividad.
+Mostrar un guin rotatorio en la esquina superior derecha a modo de
+indicador de progreso.
+.PP
+.I Navegacin al Estilo Lynx.
+Cuando la seleccin es un directorio y la lnea de rdenes est vaca
+permite cambiar a l con las flechas de movimiento. Esta opcin est
+inactiva por defecto.
+.PP
+.I Cd Sigue los Enlaces.
+Esta opcin, si est seleccionada, hace que Midnight Commander siga la
+secuencia de directorios lgica al cambiar el directorio actual, tanto en
+el panel como usando el comando cd. ste es el comportamiento por defecto
+de la shell bash. Sin esto, Midnight Commander sigue la estructura real
+de directorios, y cd .. nos trasladar al padre real del directorio
+actual aunque hayamos entrado en ese directorio a travs de un enlace,
+y no al directorio donde se encontraba el enlace.
+.PP
+.I Precauciones de Borrado.
+Dificulta el borrado accidental de archivos. La opcin por defecto en el
+dilogo de confirmacin de borrado se cambia a "No". Por defecto, esta
+opcin est desactivada.
+.\"NODE "    Layout"
+.SH "    Presentacin"
+La ventana de presentacin nos da la posibilidad de cambiar la
+presentacin general de la pantalla. Podemos configurar si son visibles
+la barra de men, la lnea de rdenes, la lnea de sugerencias o la
+barra de teclas de Funcin. En la consola Linux o FreeBSD podemos
+especificar cuntas lneas se muestran en la ventana de salida.
+.PP
+El resto del rea de pantalla se utiliza para los dos paneles de
+directorio. Podemos elegir si disponemos los paneles vertical u
+horizontalmente. La divisin puede ser simtrica o bien podemos indicar
+una divisin asimtrica.
+.PP
+Por defecto, todos los contenidos de los paneles se muestran en el mismo
+color, pero se puede indicar que
+.I permisos

+usando el color indicado por medio de la palabra clave
+.I selected.
+Si se activa el resaltado de tipos de archivos, los archivos aparecern
+coloreados segn su tipo (i.e. directorios, archivos core, ejecutables,...).
+.PP
+Si la opcin
+.I Mostrar Mini-Estado
+est activa se muestra, en la parte inferior de cada panel, una lnea
+con informacin sobre el archivo seleccionado en cada momento.
+.\"NODE "    Confirmation"
+.SH "    Confirmacin"
+En este men configuramos las opciones de confirmacin de eliminacin de archivos,
+sobreescritura, ejecucin pulsando intro y salir del programa.
+.\"NODE "    Display bits"
+.SH "    Bits de Visualizacin"
+Esta opcin es utilizada para configurar el rango de caracteres visibles en la
+pantalla. Esta seleccin puede ser 7-bits si nuestro terminal/curses soporta
+slo siete bits de salida, ISO-8859-1 muestra todos los caracteres del mapa
+ISO-8859-1 despliegue de 8 bit para aquellos terminales que puedan
+los 8 bits en toda su extensin.
+.\"NODE "    Learn keys"
+.SH "    Aprender teclas"
+Este dilogo nos permite comprobar si nuestras teclas F1-F20, Inicio, Fin, etc. funcionan adecuadamente
+en nuestro terminal. A menudo fallan, dado que muchas bases de datos de terminales estn mal.
+.PP
+Podemos movernos alrededor con la tecla Tab, con las teclas de movimiento de vi ('h' izquierda, 'j'
+abajo, 'k' arriba y 'l' derecha) y despus de pulsar cualquier tecla del cursor (esto
+las marcar con OK), entonces podremos usar esa tecla tambin.
+.PP
+Para probarlas basta con pulsar cada una de ellas. Tan pronto como pulsamos una tecla y
+sta funciona adecuadamente, OK debera aparecer junto al nombre de la susodicha tecla. Una vez
+que una tecla es marcada con OK empieza a funcionar con normalidad, p.e. F1 la primera vez
+comprobar que F1 funciona perfectamente, pero a partir de ese momento mostrar la ayuda.
+Esto mismo es aplicable a las teclas del cursor. La tecla Tab debera funcionar siempre.
+.PP
+Si algunas teclas no funcionan adecuadamente, entonces no veremos el OK tras el nombre de la tecla
+despus de haberla pulsado. Podemos entonces intentar solucionarlo. Haremos esto
+pulsando el botn de esa tecla (con el ratn o usando
+.IR Tab " e " Intro ).
+Entonces un mensaje rojo aparecer y se nos pedir que pulsemos la tecla en cuestin.
+Si deseamos abortar el proceso, bastar con pulsar
+.I Esc
+y esperar hasta que el mensaje
+desaparezca. Si no, pulsaremos la tecla que nos pide y esperaremos hasta que
+el dilogo desaparezca.
+.PP
+Cuando acabemos con todas las teclas, podramos Guardar nuestras teclas
+en nuestro archivo ~/.mc/ini dentro de la seccin [terminal:TERM] (donde TERM es el
+nombre de nuestro terminal actual) o descartarlas. Si todas nuestras teclas funcionan
+correctamente y no debemos corregir ninguna, entonces (lgico) no se grabar.

+Este dilogo permite ajustar opciones del
+.\"LINK2"
+Sistema de Archivos Virtual (VFS)\&.
+.\"Virtual File System"

+Midnight Commander guarda en memoria o en disco informacin de algunos
+de los sistemas de archivos virtuales con el fin de acelerar el acceso
+a sus archivos.  Ejemplo de esto son los listados descargados desde
+servidores FTP o los archivos temporales descomprimidos creados para
+acceder rpidamente a los contenidos de archivos tipo tar comprimidos.
+.PP
+Esas informaciones se conservan para permitirnos navegar, salir y volver a
+entrar rpidamente en los correspondientes sistemas de archivos virtuales.
+Al cabo de un cierto tiempo sin usarlos deben ser liberados y recuperar
+los recursos utilizados.  Por defecto ese tiempo es de un minuto, pero
+se puede configurar por el usuario.
+.PP
+Tambin podemos adelantar la liberacin de los VFS desde el dilogo de

+.IR "Directorios virtuales (VFS)" .
+.PP
+El

+diversas opciones.
+.PP
+.I Contrasea de FTP annimo
+es la contrasea a utilizar en conexiones en modo annimo, esto es,
+empleando el nombre de usuario "anonymous".  Algunos sitios exigen que
+sta sea una direccin de correo electrnico vlida, pero tampoco es
+conveniente dar nuestra direccin real a desconocidos para protegernos
+de los envos de correo masivo.
+.PP
+FTPfs conserva en cach los listados de los directorios consultados.
+La duracin de la cach es el valor indicado tras
+.IR "Descartar el cach FTPfs" .
+Un valor pequeo ralentiza el proceso porque cualquier pequea operacin
+ira siempre acompaada de una conexin con el servidor FTP.
+.PP
+Se puede configurar un sistema proxy para FTP, aunque los cortafuegos
+modernos son transparentes (al menos para FTP pasivo, ver ms abajo)
+y est opcin es generalmente innecesaria.

+origen para especificar el significado de los comodines en la mscara destino.
+Esto es ms flexible pero tambin necesita ms escritura. Por lo dems,
+las mscaras destino son similares al caso de Patrones Shell activos.
+.PP
+Dos ejemplos:
+.PP
+Si la mscara de origen es "^\\(.*\\)\\.tar\\.gz$", el destino es

+.\"LINK2"
+Sistema de Archivos Virtual (VFS)\&.
+.\"Virtual FS"
+.\"NODE "  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem"
+.SH "  Sistema de archivos de envo Archivos por SHell (FISH)"
+El FISH es un sistema de archivos por red que permite manipular archivos
+en una mquina remota como si estuvieran almacenados localmente. Para
+ello es preciso que el sistema remoto este ejecutando el servidor FISH
+o que la shell sea de tipo bash.
+.PP
+Para conectar con la mquina remota basta cambiar de directorio a un
+directorio virtual cuyo nombre sea de la forma:
+.PP
+.I /#sh:[usuario@]maquina[:opciones]/[directorio-remoto]
+.PP
+Los elementos
+.IR usuario ,
+.I opciones
+y
+.I directorio-remoto
+son opcionales. Si se especifica el elemento
+.I usuario
+Midnight Commander intentar entrar en la mquina remota como ese
+usuario, y si no usar nuestro nombre.
+.PP
+Como
+.I opciones
+se puede poner 'C' para usar compresin y 'rsh' para utilizar una
+conexin rsh en vez de ssh. Si se indica el
+.IR directorio-remoto ,
+se buscar ste como primer directorio al conectar con la mquina
+remota.
+.PP
+Ejemplos:
+.PP
+.nf
+    /#sh:solorsh.es:r/linux/local
+    /#sh:pepe@quiero.comprension.edu:C/privado
+    /#sh:pepe@sincomprimir.ssh.edu/privado

+.\"NODE "  Network File System"
+.SH "  Sistema de archivos de Red"
+El sistema de archivos de Midnight Commander es un sistema de archivos de red bsico que
+nos permite manipular archivos en una mquina remota como si estuviesen
+accesibles localmente. Para utilizar esto, la mquina remota debe estar ejecutando el
+programa servidor mcserv(8).
+.PP
+Para conectar a una mquina remota, slo necesitamos hacer un chdir a un
+directorio especial cuyo nombre sigue el siguiente formato:
+.PP
+.I /#mc:[usuario@]mquina[:puerto][directorio-remoto]
+.PP
+Los elementos
+.IR usuario ,
+.I puerto
+y
+.I directorio-remoto
+son opcionales. Si especificamos el elemento
+.I usuario
+entonces Midnight Commander intentar acceder a la
+mquina como ese usuario, si no, usar nuestro login.
+.PP
+El elemento
+.I puerto
+es necesario cuando el servidor remoto se ejecuta en un puerto especial
+(vase la pgina del manual de mcserv(8) para ms informacin acerca de
+puertos); finalmente, si el elemento
+.I directorio-remoto
+est presente, nuestro directorio actual en la mquina remota
+ser ste.
+.PP
+Ejemplos:
+.PP
+.nf

+    /#mc:pepe@foo.edu:11321/privado
+.fi
+.\"NODE "  SMB File System"
+.SH "  Sistema de archivos SMB"
+El SMBfs permite manipular archivos en mquinas remotas con el protocolo
+denominado SMB (o CIFS). Esto incluye Windows Trabajo en Grupo, Windows
+9x/ME/XP, Windows NT, Windows 2000 y Samba. Para comenzar a usarlo,
+se puede emplear la "Conexin por SMB..." (accesible desde la barra de
+mens) o bien cambiar de directorio a un directorio virtual cuyo nombre
+sea de la forma:
+.PP
+.I /#smb:[usuario@]maquina[/recurso][/directorio-remoto]
+.PP
+Los elementos
+.IR usuario ,
+.I recurso
+y
+.I directorio-remoto
+son opcionales. El

+.\"NODE "  Undelete File System"
+.SH "  Sistema de archivos de Recuperacin"
+En sistemas Linux, si el programa de configuracin nos pregunt si queramos usar
+las facilidades de recuperacin de archivos de ext2fs, tendremos el sistema de archivos
+recuperables accesible.
+La recuperacin de archivos borrados est disponible slo en los sistemas de archivos ext2. El
+sistema de archivos recuperable es slo un interface de la librera ext2fs con:
+restaurar todos los archivos borrados en un ext2fs y proporciona
+la extraccin selectiva de archivos en una particin regular.
+.PP
+Para usar este sistema de archivos, tendremos que hacer un chdir a un nombre de archivo especial
+formado por el prefijo "/#undel" y el nombre de archivo donde se encuentra el
+sistema de archivos actual.
+.PP
+Por ejemplo, para recuperar archivos borrados en la segunda particin del
+primer disco scsi en Linux, usaramos el siguiente nombre de ruta:
+.PP
+.nf
+    /#undel:sda2
+.fi
+.PP
+Esto le llevara un tiempo a undelfs para cargar la informacin
+antes de empezar a navegar por los archivos all contenidos.
+.\"NODE "  EXTernal File System"
+.SH "  Sistema de archivos EXTerno (extfs)"
+.B extfs
+permite incorporar a GNU Midnight Commander numerosas utilidades y tipos
+de archivos de manera sencilla, simplemente escribiendo guiones
+(scripts).
+.PP
+Los sistemas de archivos Extfs son de dos tipos:
+.PP
+1. Sistemas de archivos autnomos, que no estn asociados a ningn
+archivo existente. Representan algn tipo de informacin relacionada con
+el sistema en forma de rbol de directorios. Se accede a ellos ejecutando
+.RI ' "cd #nombrefs" '
+donde nombrefs es el nombre corto que identifica el extfs (ver ms
+adelante).  Ejemplos de stos son audio (lista de pistas de sonido en
+el CD) o apt (lista de paquetes de tipo Debian en el sistema).
+.PP
+Por ejemplo, para listar las pistas de msica del CD, escribir
+.PP
+.nf
+  cd #audio
+.fi
+.PP
+2. Sistemas de archivos en un archivo (como rpm, patchfs y ms), que
+muestran los contenidos de un archivo en forma de rbol de directorios.
+Puede tratarse de archivos reales empaquetados o comprimidos en un archivo
+(urar, rpm) o archivos virtuales, como puede ser el caso de mensajes
+en un archivo de correo electrnico (mailfs) o partes de un archivo de
+modificaciones o parches (patchfs). Para acceder a ellos se aade
+.RI ' #nombrefs '
+al nombre del archivo a abrir. Este archivo podra l mismo estar en
+otro sistema de archivos virtual.
+.PP
+Por ejemplo, para listar los contenidos de un archivo documentos.zip
+comprimido hay que escribir
+.PP
+.nf
+  cd documentos.zip#uzip
+.fi
+.PP
+En muchos aspectos, se puede tratar un sistema de archivos externo como
+cualquier otro directorio. Podramos aadirlo a la lista de favoritos o
+cambiar a l desde la historia de directorios. Una limitacin importante
+es que, estando dentro de l, no se puede ejecutar rdenes del sistema,
+como por otra parte ocurre en cualquier sistema de archivos VFS no local.
+.PP
+Midnigth Commander incluye inicialmente guiones para algunos sistemas de
+archivos externos:
+.TP
+.B a
+acceder a un disquete DOS/Windows 'A:'
+.RI ( "cd #a" ).
+.TP
+.B apt

+.\"NODE "Colors"
+.SH "Colores"
+Midnight Commander intentar determinar si nuestro terminal soporta
+el uso de color utilizando la base de datos de terminales y nuestro nombre de terminal. Algunas veces
+estar confundido, por lo que deberemos forzar el modo en color o deshabilitar el modo de color
+usando el argumento -c y -b respectivamente.
+.PP
+Si el programa est compilado con el gestor pantallas Slang
+en lugar de ncurses, tambin chequear la variable
+.B COLORTERM,
+si existe, lo que tiene el mismo efecto que la opcin -c.
+.PP
+Podemos especificar a los terminales que siempre fuercen el modo en color
+aadiendo la variable
+.I color_terminals
+a la seccin Colors del archivo de inicializacin. Esto evitar que
+Midnight Commander intente la deteccin de soporte de color. Ejemplo:
+.PP
+.nf
+[Colors]
+color_terminals=linux,xterm
+.fi
+.nf
+color_terminals=nombre-terminal1,nombre-terminal2...
+.fi
+.PP
+El programa puede compilarse con ncurses y slang, ncurses no
+ofrece la posibilidad de forzar el modo en color: ncurses utiliza la
+informacin de la base de datos de terminales.
+.PP
+Midnight Commander ofrece una forma de cambiar los colores por defecto.
+Actualmente los colores se configuran a travs de la variable de entorno
+.B MC_COLOR_TABLE
+o en la seccin Colors del archivo de inicializacin.
+.PP
+En la seccin Colors, el mapa de colores por defecto se carga desde la variable
+.IR base_color .
+Podemos especificar un mapa de colores alternativo para un terminal
+utilizando el nombre del terminal como clave en esta seccin. Ejemplo:
+.PP
+.nf
+[Colors]
+base_color=
+xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red
+.fi
+.PP
+El formato de la definicin de color es:
+.PP
+.nf
+  <PalabraClave>=<ColorTexto>,<ColorFondo>:<PalabraClave>= ...
+.fi
+.PP
+los colores son opcionales, y las palabras claves son: normal, selected,
+marked, markselect, errors, input, reverse menu, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel,
+gauge;  los colores por defecto son: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus;
+Los colores de Ayuda son: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink,
+helpslink; Color del visor: viewunderline; Modo especial resaltado:
+executable, directory, link, stalelink, device, special, core.
+Colores del editor: editnormal, editbold, editmarked.
+.PP
+Los cuadros de dilogo usan los siguientes colores:
+.I dnormal
+usado para el texto normal,
+.I dfocus
+usado para el componente actualmente seleccionado,
+.I dhotnormal
+usado para diferenciar el color de la tecla activa
+en los componentes normales, mientras que el color
+.I dhotfocus
+se utiliza para el color resaltado en el componente seleccionado.
+.PP
+Los mens utilizan el mismo esquema equivalente con los nombres menu, menusel, menuhot and
+menuhotsel en lugar de los anteriores.
+.PP
+La ayuda utiliza los siguientes colores:
+.I helpnormal
+texto normal,
+.I helpitalic
+utilizado para el texto enfatizado con letra itlica en la pgina del manual,
+.I helpbold
+usado para el texto enfatizado en negrita en la pgina del manual,
+.I helplink
+usado para los hiperenlaces no seleccionados y
+.I helpslink
+es utilizado para el hiperenlace seleccionado.
+.PP
+.I gauge (indicador)
+determina el color de la parte completada de la barra de progresin (gauge), que muestra
+qu porcentaje de archivos fueron copiados etc. de modo grfico.
+.PP
+Para el modo de resaltado del tipo de archivos,
+.I directory
+especifica el color con que se muestran los directorios;
+.I executable
+para los archivos ejecutables;
+.I link
+usado para representar enlaces;
+.I device
+para dispositivos de caracteres y de bloque;
+.I special
+para archivos especiales, tales como colas (FIFO) e IPC sockets;
+.I core
+es para los archivos volcados (vase tambin la opcin
+.B highlight_mode

+.fi
+.\"NODE "Special Settings"
+.SH "Ajustes Especiales"
+La mayora de las opciones de Midnight Commander pueden cambiarse desde
+los mens. Sin embargo, hay un pequeo nmero de ajustes para los que
+es necesario editar el archivo de configuracin.
+.PP
+Estas variables se pueden cambiar en nuestro archivo ~/.mc/ini:
+.PP
+.I clear_before_exec
+.IP
+Por defecto Midnight Commander limpia la pantalla antes de ejecutar un
+comando. Si preferimos ver la salida del comando en la parte inferior
+de la pantalla, editaremos nuestro archivo ~/mc.ini y cambiaremos el
+valor del campo clear_before_exec a 0.
+.PP
+.I confirm_view_dir
+.IP
+Al pulsar F3 en un directorio, normalmente MC entra en ese directorio. Si
+este valor est a 1, entonces MC pedir confirmacin antes de cambiar
+el directorio si tenemos archivos marcados.
+.PP
+.I ftpfs_retry_seconds
+.IP
+Este valor es el nmero de segundos que Midnight Commander esperar
+antes de intentar volver a conectar con un servidor de ftp que ha denegado el
+acceso. Si el valor es cero, el programa no reintentar el acceso.
+.PP
+.I ftpfs_use_passive_connections
+.IP
+Esta opcin est desactivada por defecto. Hace que el cdigo de FTPfs utilice el
+modo de apertura pasivo para transferir archivos. Esto es usado por aquellos
+que estn detrs de un encaminador con filtrado de paquetes. Esta opcin slo funciona si
+estamos utilizando un proxy para ftp.
+.PP
+.I max_dirt_limit
+.IP
+Especifica cuntas actualizaciones de pantalla pueden saltarse al menos en el visor
+de archivos interno. Normalmente este valor no es significativo, porque
+el cdigo automticamente ajusta el nmero de actualizaciones a saltar de acuerdo
+al volumen de pulsaciones de teclas recibidas. Empero, en mquinas muy lentas o
+en terminales con autorepeticin de teclado rpida, un valor grande puede hacer
+que la pantalla se actualice dando saltos.
+.IP
+Parece ser que poniendo max_dirt_limit a 10 produce el mejor comportamiento,
+y ste es el valor por defecto.
+.PP
+.I mouse_move_pages
+.IP
+Controla cundo el desplazamiento de pantalla realizado con el ratn se realiza por pginas o lnea
+a lnea en los paneles.
+.PP
+.I mouse_move_pages_viewer
+.IP
+Controla cundo el desplazamiento de pantalla realizado con el ratn se realiza por pginas o lnea
+a lnea en el visor de archivos interno.
+.PP
+.I old_esc_mode
+.IP
+Por defecto Midnight Commander trata la tecla 
+.I Esc
+como prefijo de tecla
+(old_esc_mode=0), si activamos esta opcin (old_esc_mode=1), entonces
+la tecla 
+.I Esc
+actuar como prefijo de tecla durante un segundo, y si no hay
+pulsaciones, entonces 
+.I Esc
+ser interpretado como la tecla de cancelacin (
+.IR Esc " " Esc
+).
+.PP
+.I only_leading_plus_minus
+.IP
+Produce un tratamiento especial para '+', '-', '*' en la lnea de rdenes (seleccionar,
+deseleccionar, seleccin inversa) slo si la lnea de rdenes est vaca. No necesitamos
+entrecomillar estos caracteres en la lnea de rdenes. Pero no podremos
+cambiar la seleccin cuando la lnea de rdenes no est vaca.
+.PP
+.I panel_scroll_pages
+.IP
+Si existe (por defecto), el panel se desplazar media pantalla cuando el cursor
+alcance el final o el principio del panel, en otro caso se desplazar un archivo cada vez.
+.PP
+.I show_output_starts_shell
+.IP
+Esta variable slo funciona si no se utiliza el soporte de subshell.
+Cuando utilizamos la combinacin
+.I Ctrl-o
+para volver a la pantalla de usuario, si est activada, tendremos un
+nuevo shell. De otro modo, pulsando cualquier tecla nos devolver a
+Midnight Commander.
+.PP
+.I torben_fj_mode
+.IP
+Si este modificador existe, entonces las teclas Inicio y Fin funcionarn de manera
+diferente en los paneles, en lugar de mover la seleccin al primer
+o ltimo archivo en los paneles, actuarn como sigue:
+.IP
+La tecla Inicio: Ir a la lnea central del panel, si est bajo ella; sino va a
+la primera lnea a menos que ya est all, en este caso
+ir al primer archivo del panel.
+.IP
+La tecla Fin tiene un comportamiento similar: Ir a la lnea central del panel, si
+est situada en la mitad superior del panel; si no ir a la lnea inferior del panel a menos que
+ya estemos ah, en cuyo caso mover la seleccin al ltimo nombre de archivo del panel.
+.PP
+.I use_file_to_guess_type
+.IP
+Si esta variable est activada (por defecto lo est) se recurrir al
+comando "file" para reconocer los tipos de archivo referidos en el archivo
+.\"LINK2"
+mc.ext\&.
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+.PP
+.I xterm_mode
+.IP
+Si esta variable est activada (por defecto no) cuando naveguemos
+por el sistema de archivos en un panel en rbol, se ir actualizando
+automticamente el otro panel con los contenidos del directorio
+seleccionado en cada momento.
+.\"NODE "Terminal databases"
+.SH "Ajustes del Terminal"
+Midnight Commander permite hacer ajustes a la base de datos de terminales

+.PP
+Il Midnight Commander fornisce la vista di due directory 
+contemporaneamente. Uno dei due pannelli  quello corrente (la barra
+di selezione  presente solo in questo). Quasi tutte le operazioni
+hanno luogo nel pannello corrente. Alcune azioni come Rinomina e 
+Copia usano la directory del pannello non selezionato come valore
+predefinito di destinazione (ma si richiede sempre una conferma prima).

+.PP
+La sezione
+.\"LINK2"
+shell a riga di comando
+.\"Shell Command Line"
+elenca i tasti utilizzati per immettere e modificare linee di comando.
+Molti di questi copiano nomi di file o altro dal pannello directory
+alla riga di comando (per evitare troppo lavoro di battitura) o per
+accedere alla cronologia comandi.
+.PP
+I
+.\"LINK2"

+corrente mentre il pannello corrente diventa l'altro pannello.
+La barra di selezione si sposta dal vecchio pannello al nuovo corrente.
+.TP
+.B Ins, C-t
+per marcare i file si pu usare il tasto di Inserimento (la sequenza
+teminfo kich1) o la sequenza C-t (Control-t). Per smarcare i file
+basta marcare un file gi marcato.
+.TP
+.B M-g, M-r, M-j
+usato per selezionare rispettivamente il file superiore, il file centrale o 
+quello inferiore in un pannello.
+.TP
+.B C-s, M-s
+inizia una ricerca nella directory. Quando la ricerca  attiva i dati
+immessi dall'utente vengono aggiunti alla stringa di ricerca invece
+della riga di comando. Se l'opzione
+.I Mostra mini-stato
+ abilitata, la stringa di ricerca viene mostrata nella riga di
+mini-stato. Scrivendo, la barra di selezione si muove al prossimo
+file che comincia con le lettere battute. I tasti
+.I backspace
+o
+.I canc 
+possono essere utilizzati per correggere errori di battitura. Se viene premuto
+nuovamente, viene ricercata la corrispondenza successiva.

+.PP
+Crea un collegamento simbolico al file corrente. Per chi non sapesse
+cosa sono i collegamenti: creare un collegamento ad un file  come
+copiare il file ma sia il nome sorgente che destinazione rappresentano
+la stessa immagine fisica del file. Per esempio, se si modifica uno dei
+due file, tutti i cambiamenti appariranno su tutti i file. Alcuni li
+chiamano anche alias o scorciatoie (o link come in originale inglese).
+.PP
+Un collegamento fisico appare come un file reale. Dopo che sia stato 
+creato non c' modo di distinguere quale sia il collegamento e quale sia 
+l'originale. Se si cancella uno dei due l'altro rimarr intatto. E' molto
+difficile notare che i file rappresentano la stessa immagine. Usate i
+collegamenti fisici quando non volete proprio saperlo.
+.PP
+Un collegamento simbolico  un riferimento al nome del file originale.
+Se il file originale viene cancellato, il collegamento  inutile.
+E' facile distinguere i collegamenti simbolici dall'immagine stessa.
+Se il file  un collegamento simbolico a qualcosa, il Midnight Commander
+mostra un simbolo "@" davanti al nome del file (eccetto se punta ad una

+significa che  necessario proteggere i caratteri con significati speciali per
+egrep con "\\", per esempio se si ricerca "strcmp (" si dovr immettere 
+"strcmp \\(" (senza le virgolette).
+.PP
+Per far partire la ricerca premere il tasto Ok.
+E' possibile bloccare la ricerca con il tasto Sospende e farla riprendere
+con il tasto Continua.
+.PP
+E' possibile navigare l'elenco file con i tasti freccia Su e Gi.
+Il tasto Chdir cambier la directory corrente a quella del file selezionato.
+Il tasto Ripete chieder nuovamente i parametri per una nuova ricerca.
+Il tasto Uscita esce dal comando Trova. Il tasto Pannellizza
+metter i file trovati sul pannello di directory corrente cosicch si
+possa svolgere ulteriori operazioni su di essi (visualizzazione, copia, 
+spostamento, e cos via). Dopo la pannellizzazione  possibile premere C-r
+per ripristinare la vista normale dei file.
+.PP
+E' possibile avere una lista di directory che il comando trova file dovrebbe
+saltare durante la ricerca (per esempio, si pu evitare di fare ricerche su
+un CDROM o su una directory NFS montata attraverso un collegamento lento).
+.PP
+Le directory che devono essere saltate devono essere impostate nella variabile
+.B find_ignore_dirs 
+nella sezione
+.B Misc
+del file ~/.mc/ini.
+.PP
+Le directory devono essere separate da una virgola, come nell'esempio:
+.PP
+.nf
+[Misc]
+find_ignore_dirs=/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs
+.fi
+.PP
+Si pu prendere in considerazione l'uso del comando
+.\"LINK2"
+pannellizza comando
+.\"External panelize"
+per operazioni particolari. Il comando trova file serve solo per 
+ricerche semplici mentre usando pannellizza comando si pu fare 
+ricerche complesse come si vuole.
+.\"NODE "    External panelize"
+.SH "    Pannellizza comando"
+Pannellizza comando permette di eseguire un programma esterno, e
+mettere il risultato del programma nel pannello corrente.
+.PP
+Per esempio, se si vuole manipolare in uno dei pannelli tutti i collegamenti
+simbolici nella directory corrente, basta usare pannellizza comando per
+eseguire il seguente:
+.PP
+.nf
+find . -type l -print
+.fi
+.PP
+Al completamento del comando, il contenuto del pannello non sar pi
+il listato della directory ma tutti i file che rappresentano
+collegamenti simbolici.
+.PP
+Volendo pannellizzare tutti i file che sono stati scaricati dal
+proprio server ftp preferito, si pu usare questo comando awk per
+estrarre il nome del file dal file di log del traferimento:
+.PP
+.nf
+awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /usr/adm/xferlog
+.fi
+.PP
+Se si desidera si pu salvare i comandi di pannellizzazione usati pi 
+spesso con uno nome pi descrittivo, in maniera da richiamarli pi velocemente.
+Per fare ci basta battere il comando sulla riga di ingresso e premere il tasto
+Aggiungi nuovo. Poi si deve dare un nome al quale associare il comando che si
+desidera salvare. La prossima volta sar possibile scegliere quel comando 
+dall'elenco e non servir ribatterlo nuovamente.
+.\"NODE "    Hotlist"
+.SH "    Directory favorite"
+Il comando Directory favorite mostra le etichette delle directory nell'elenco
+delle favorite. Il Midnight Commander andr alla directory corrispondente
+all'etichetta selezionata. Dalla finestra delle favorite si possono rimuovere
+etichette/directory gi create ed aggiungerne di nuove. Per aggiungere 
+velocemente nuove directory basta usare il comando Aggiungi alle favorite 
+(C-x h), che aggiunge la directory corrente alla lista delle favorite,
+richiedendo l'etichetta per identificarla.
+.PP
+Questo rende pi veloce il cd verso directory usate spesso. Considera l'uso della
+variabile CDPATH come descritto in
+.\"LINK2"
+comando cd interno\&.
+.\"The cd internal command"
+.\"NODE "    Extension File Edit"

+.\"NODE "    Background jobs"
+.SH "    Processi in background"
+Questo comando permette di controllare lo stato di ogni processo
+in background del Midnight Commander (in background possono essere
+eseguite solo operazioni di copia e rinomina). Da qui si pu bloccare, 
+far ripartire e uccidere un lavoro in background.
+.\"NODE "    Menu File Edit"

+ma solo se  di propriet dell'utente o di root e se non  scrivibile
+a tutti. Se tale file non viene trovato, mc alla stessa maniera 
+prova con ~/.mc/menu altrimenti usa il menu di sistema
+@prefix@/share/mc/mc.menu.
+.PP
+Il formato del file menu  molto semplice. Le righe che cominciano
+con qualsiasi cosa che non sia uno spazio o una tabulazione sono
+considerate voci per il menu (per fare in modo di usarle anche come
+scelta rapida, il primo carattere deve essere una lettera). Tutte le
+righe che cominciano con uno spazio o un tab sono i comandi che verranno
+eseguiti quando la voce viene selezionata.
+.PP
+Quando un'opzione viene selezionata tutte le linee di comando dell'opzione
+vengono copiate in un file temporaneo nella directory temporanea (normalmente
+/usr/tmp) e poi il file viene eseguito. Ci permette all'utente di mettere
+normali costrutti shell nei menu. Prima dell'esecuzione del codice del menu
+ha luogo una semplice sostituzione di macro. Per ulteriori informazioni vedere
+.\"LINK2"
+sostituzione macro\&.

+.I Mostra file di backup.
+Se abilitata, il Midnight Commander mostrer i file che terminano con una tilde.
+Altrimenti essi non verranno mostrati (come nell'opzione -B del comando GNU ls).
+.PP
+.I Mostra file nascosti.
+Se abilitata, il Midnight Commander mostrer tutti i file che cominciano con
+un punto (come ls -a).
+.PP

+.BR F9 .
+Altrimenti si otterr solo il titolo del menu e si dovr attivare il menu con
+i tasti freccia o con i tasti di selezione rapida.
+E' raccomandata se si stanno usando i tasti di selezione rapida.
+.PP
+.I Mescola tutti i file.
+Se quest'opzione  abilitata, tutti i file e le directory vengono mostrati
+mescolati insieme. Se l'opzione  spenta, le directory (e i collegamenti a
+sottodirectory) vengono mostrati all'inizio dell'elenco con gli altri file
+a seguire.
+.PP
+.I Aggiornamento rapido directory.
+Se quest'opzione  abilitata, il Midnight Commander user un trucco per
+determinare se i contenuti della directory sono cambiati. Il trucco consiste
+nel ricaricare la directory solo se l'i-node della directory  cambiato.
+Ci significa che la ricarica accade solo quando i file vengono creati o
+cancellati. Se quello che cambia  l'i-node di un file nella directory 
+(cambia l'ampiezza di un file, cambiano il proprietario o le flag, etc.)
+la visualizzazione non viene aggiornata. In questi casi se l'opzione 
+abilitata,  necessario ricaricare la directory manualmente (con C-r).
+.PP
+.B Pausa dopo l'esecuzione
+.PP
+Dopo l'esecuzione di comandi, il Midnight Commander pu fermarsi, in
+maniera da permettere di esaminare il risultato del comando. Ci sono
+tre possibili impostazioni per questa variabile:
+.IP
+.I Mai.
+Significa che non si vuole vedere il risultato del comando. Se si sta
+usando la console Linux o FreeBSD o un xterm, ci sar la possibilit di
+vedere il risultato del comando premendo C-o.

+.I Su terminali stupidi.
+Si avr il messaggio di pausa su quei terminali che non sono in grado di
+mostrare il risultato dell'ultimo comando eseguito (qualsiasi terminale
+che non sia un xterm o una console Linux o FreeBSD).
+.IP
+.I Sempre.
+Il programma si fermer dopo l'esecuzione di tutti i comandi.
+.PP
+.B Altre opzioni
+.PP
+.I Operazioni prolisse.
+Quest'opzione decide se le operazioni di Copia, Spostamento o Cancellazione
+saranno prolisse (cio se mostreranno una finestra di dialogo per ogni 
+operazione). Se si ha un terminale lento potresti voler disabilitare 
+quest'opzione. Viene automaticamente spenta se la velocit del proprio 
+terminale  inferiore a 9600 bps.
+.PP
+.I Calcola totali.
+Se quest'opzione  abilitata, il Midnight Commander calcoler i totali 
+delle ampiezze in byte e il numero totale dei file prima di ogni operazione di 
+Copia, Spostamento o Cancellazione. Questo generer una barra di progressione
+pi accurata a discapito di un po' di velocit. Quest'opzione non ha effetto se
+.I Operazioni prolisse
+ disabilitata.
+.PP
+.I Modelli della shell.
+Normalmente i comandi Seleziona, Deseleziona e Filtro usano espressioni
+regolari di tipo shell. Le seguenti conversioni vengono eseguite per
+ottenere questo risultato: '*' viene rimpiazzato da '.*' (zero o pi
+caratteri); '?' viene rimpiazzato da '.' (esattamente un carattere) e '.' 
+dal carattere letterale punto. Se l'opzione  disabilitata, allora le 
+espressioni regolari sono quelle descritte in ed(1).
+.PP
+.I Autosalva configurazione.
+Se quest'opzione  abilitata, quando si esce dal Midnight Commander le
+opzioni configurabili del Midnight Commander vengono salvate nel file
+~/.mc/ini.
+.PP
+.I Menu automatici.

+Midnight Commander segue la reale struttura della directory, perci
+eseguendo cd .. se si  entrati in una directory attraverso un
+collegamento, ci porter alla genitrice reale della directory corrente
+e non alla directory dov'era il collegamento.
+.PP
+.I Cancellazione sicura.
+Se quest'opzione  abilitata, la cancellazione non intenzionale dei file

+.\"NODE "    Virtual FS"
+.SH "    FS virtuale "
+Quest'opzione permette di controllare l'impostazione della cache informazioni 
+del
+.\"LINK2"
+file system virtuale\&.
+.\"Virtual File System"
+.PP
+Il Midnight Commander tiene in memoria le informazioni
+relative ad alcuni dei file system virtuali per accelerare
+l'accesso all'elenco dei file nel file system (per esempio,
+l'elenco dei file scaricato dai server ftp).
+.PP
+Inoltre, per accedere al contenuto dei file compressi (per
+esempio file tar compressi) il Midnight Commander deve creare
+un file temporaneo non compresso sul disco.
+.PP
+Siccome sia le informazioni in memoria che i file temporanei su
+disco occupano risorse, si pu voler impostare i parametri delle
+informazioni della cache per ridurre l'uso delle risorse o per
+massimizzare la velocit di accesso ai file system usati spesso.
+.PP
+A causa del formato degli archivi tar, il
+.I filesystem tar
+necessita di leggere l'intero file solo per caricare le voci dei 
+file. Dato che molti file tar sono compressi (i file
+tar non compressi sono una specie in via di estinzione), 
+il file system tar deve decomprimere il file su disco, 
+in una locazione temporanea per poi accedervi come un file tar 
+normale.
+.PP
+Ora, visto che noi tutti amiamo navigare nei file e nei file tar 
+dappertutto su disco, succede spesso che si lascia un file tar per 
+poi rientrarvi successivamente. Siccome la decompressione  lenta, 
+il Midnight Commander conserver l'informazione in memoria per un 
+tempo limitato, allo scadere del quale, tutte le risorse associate 
+al file system verranno liberate. La scadenza predefinita  impostata 
+a un minuto.

+Il valore predefinito del Midnight Commander  di cancellare lo schermo
+prima dell'esecuzione di un comando. Se si preferisce vedere il risultato
+di un comando in fondo allo schermo, si modifichi la copia locale del file
+~/.mc/ini e si cambi il valore del campo clear_before_exec a 0.

+.I confirm_view_dir
+Se si preme F3 su di una directory, normalmente MC entra nella directory.
+Se questa opzione  impostata a 1, MC chieder una conferma prima di
+cambiare directory se si hanno dei file marcati.
+.TP
+.I ftpfs_retry_seconds
+Questo valore  il numero di secondi che il Midnight Commander aspetta
+prima di tentare di riconnettersi ad un ftp server che ha negato
+l'autenticazione. Se il valore  zero, l'autenticazione non verr ritentata.
+.TP
+.I max_dirt_limit
+Specifica al massimo quanti aggiornamenti possono essere saltati nel
+visualizzatore di file interno. Normalmente questo valore non  
+significativo, dato che il codice automaticamente aggiusta il numero 
+da saltare a seconda della velocit con cui arrivano le pressioni dei 
+tasti. Comunque, su macchine molto lente o su terminali con un'auto
+ripetizione dei tasti molto veloce, un grande valore pu rendere gli
+aggiornamenti dello schermo troppo instabili.

+quando il cursore raggiunge la fine o l'inizio del pannello, 
+altrimenti scorrono di un file per volta.
+.TP
+.I show_output_starts_shell
+Questa variabile lavora solo se non si sta usando il supporto della 
+subshell. Quando si usano i tasti C-o per tornare allo schermo utente,
+se quest'opzione  impostata, si avr una nuova shell. Altrimenti,
+premendo qualsiasi tasto si torner al Midnight Commander.
+.TP
+.I torben_fj_mode
+Se quest'opzione  impostata, allora i tasti inizio e fine lavoreranno
+leggermente differentemente sui pannelli. Invece che muovere le selezioni
+al primo e ultimo file del pannello, agiranno nel modo seguente:
+.IP
+Il tasto inizio: va alla riga centrale, se sotto di essa, altrimenti
+va alla riga in cima a meno che non ci sia gi; in tal caso andr al
+primo file del pannello.
+.IP
+Il tasto fine ha un comportamento simile: va gi alla riga centrale

+the other panel.
+.\"NODE "Overview"
+.SH "Overview"
+The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into four parts.
+Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels.
+By default, the second line from the bottom of the screen is the
+shell command line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels.
+The topmost line is the
+.\"LINK2"
+menu bar line\&.
+.\"Menu Bar"
+The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the
+topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key.
+.PP
+The Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same
+time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in
+the current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current
+panel. Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the
+directory of the unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they
+always ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the
+sections on the
+.\"LINK2"
+Directory Panels\&,
+.\"Directory Panels"
+the
+.\"LINK2"
+Left and Right Menus
+.\"Left and Right Menus"
+and the
+.\"LINK2"
+File Menu\&.
+.\"File Menu"
+.PP
+You can execute system commands from the Midnight Commander by simply
+typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line,
+and when you press Enter the Midnight Commander will execute the
+command line you typed; read the
+.\"LINK2"
+Shell Command Line
+.\"Shell Command Line"
+and
+.\"LINK2"
+Input Line Keys
+.\"Input Line Keys"
+sections to learn more about the command line.
+.\"NODE "Mouse Support"
+.SH "Mouse Support"
+The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support.  It is activated
+whenever you are running on an
+.B xterm(1)
+terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to
+another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on a Linux
+console and have the
+.B gpm
+mouse server running.
+.PP
+When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is
+selected; if you click with the right button, the file is marked (or
+unmarked, depending on the previous state).
+.PP
+Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is
+an executable program; and if the
+.\"LINK2"
+extension file
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+has a program specified for the file's extension, the specified
+program is executed.
+.PP
+Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function
+key labels by clicking on them.
+.PP
+If a mouse button is clicked on the top frame line of the directory panel,
+it is scrolled one page up.  Likewise, a click on the bottom frame line
+will cause scrolling one page down.  This frame line method works also
+in the
+.\"LINK2"
+Help Viewer
+.\"Contents"
+and the
+.\"LINK2"
+Directory Tree\&.
+.\"Directory Tree"
+.PP
+The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400
+milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by editing the
+.\"LINK2"
+\&~/.mc/ini
+.\"Save Setup"
+file and changing the
+.I mouse_repeat_rate
+parameter.
+.PP
+If you are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you
+can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding
+down the Shift key.
+.SH ""
+.\"NODE "Keys"
+.SH "Keys"
+Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of the
+.I Control
+(sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the
+.I Meta
+(sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this manual we will
+use the following abbreviations:
+.TP
+.B C-<chr>
+means hold the Control key while typing the character <chr>.
+Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.
+.TP
+.B Alt-<chr>
+means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing <chr>.
+If there is no Meta or Alt key, type
+.IR ESC , 
+release it, then type the character <chr>.
+.TP
+.B S-<chr>
+means hold the Shift key down while typing <chr>.
+.PP
+All input lines in the Midnight Commander use an approximation to
+the GNU Emacs editor's key bindings.
+.PP
+There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are
+the most important.
+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+File Menu
+.\"File Menu"
+section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in
+the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of these
+commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the
+tagged files.
+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+Directory Panels
+.\"Directory Panels"
+section documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a
+target for a later action (the action is usually one from the file
+menu).
+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+Shell Command Line
+.\"Shell Command Line"
+section list the keys which are used for entering and editing command
+lines. Most of these copy file names and such from the directory
+panels to the command line (to avoid excessive typing) or access the
+command line history.
+.PP
+.\"LINK2"
+Input Line Keys
+.\"Input Line Keys"
+are used for editing input lines. This means both the command line and
+the input lines in the query dialogs.
+.\"NODE "  Miscellaneous Keys"
+.SH "  Miscellaneous Keys"
+Here are some keys which don't fall into any of the other categories:
+.TP 
+.B Enter
+if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of
+the panels), then that command is executed. If there is no text in the
+command line then if the selection bar is over a directory the
+Midnight Commander does a
+.B chdir(2)
+to the selected directory and reloads the information on the panel;
+if the selection is an executable file then it is executed. Finally,
+if the extension of the selected file name matches one of the
+extensions in the
+.\"LINK2"
+extensions file
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+then the corresponding command is executed.
+.TP
+.B C-l
+repaint all the information in the Midnight Commander.
+.TP
+.B C-x c
+run the
+.\"LINK2"
+Chmod
+.\"Chmod"
+command on a file or on the tagged files.
+.TP 
+.B C-x o
+run the
+.\"LINK2"
+Chown
+.\"Chown"
+command on the current file or on the tagged files.
+.TP
+.B C-x l
+run the link command.
+.TP
+.B C-x s
+run the symbolic link command.
+.TP
+.B C-x i
+set the other panel display mode to information.
+.TP
+.B C-x q
+set the other panel display mode to quick view.
+.TP
+.B C-x !
+execute the
+.\"LINK2"
+External panelize
+.\"External panelize"
+command.
+.TP
+.B C-x h
+run the
+.\"LINK2"
+add directory to hotlist
+.\"Hotlist"
+command.
+.TP
+.B Alt-!
+executes the Filtered view command, described in the
+.\"LINK2"
+view command\&.
+.\"Internal File Viewer"
+.TP
+.B Alt-?
+executes the
+.\"LINK2"
+Find file
+.\"Find File"
+command.
+.TP
+.B Alt-c
+pops up the
+.\"LINK2"
+quick cd
+.\"Quick cd"
+dialog.
+.TP
+.B C-o
+when the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under
+an xterm, it will show you the output of the previous command.  When ran
+on the Linux console, the Midnight Commander uses an external program
+(cons.saver) to handle saving and restoring of information on the
+screen.
+.PP
+When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o at any time
+and you will be taken back to the Midnight Commander main screen, to
+return to your application just type C-o.  If you have an application
+suspended by using this trick, you won't be able to execute other
+programs from the Midnight Commander until you terminate the suspended
+application.
+.\"NODE "  Directory Panels"
+.SH "  Directory Panels"
+This section lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If
+you want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take a
+look at the section on
+.\"LINK2"
+Left and Right Menus\&.
+.\"Left and Right Menus"
+.TP
+.B Tab, C-i
+change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the new current
+panel and the old current panel becomes the new other panel. The
+selection bar moves from the old current panel to the new current
+panel.
+.TP
+.B Insert, C-t
+to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo sequence)
+or the C-t (Control-t) sequence. To untag files, just retag a tagged
+file.
+.TP
+.B Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j
+used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and the bottom one,
+respectively.
+.TP
+.B C-s, Alt-s
+start a filename search in the directory listing. When the search is
+active, the user input will be added to the search string instead of
+the command line. If the
+.I Show mini-status
+option is enabled the search string is shown on the mini-status
+line. When typing, the selection bar will move to the next file
+starting with the typed letters. The
+.I backspace
+or
+.I DEL
+keys can be used to correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed
+again, the next match is searched for.
+.TP
+.B Alt-t
+toggle the current display listing to show the next display listing
+mode.
+With this it is possible to quickly switch to brief listing, long
+listing, user defined listing mode, and back to the default.
+.TP
+.B C-\\\\ (control-backslash)
+show the
+.\"LINK2"
+directory hotlist
+.\"Hotlist"
+and change to the selected directory.
+.TP
+.B + \ (plus)
+this is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander
+will prompt for a regular expression describing the group. When
+.I Shell Patterns
+are enabled, the regular expression is much like the regular
+expressions in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?
+standing for one character). If
+.I Shell Patterns
+is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular
+expressions (see ed (1)).
+.PP
+If the expression starts or ends with a slash (/), then it will select
+directories instead of files.
+.TP
+.B \\\\ (backslash)
+use the "\\" key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of
+the Plus key.
+.TP
+.B up-key, C-p
+move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel.
+.TP
+.B down-key, C-n
+move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.
+.TP
+.B home, a1, Alt-<
+move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.
+.TP
+.B end, c1, Alt->
+move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.
+.TP
+.B next-page, C-v
+move the selection bar one page down.
+.TP
+.B prev-page, Alt-v
+move the selection bar one page up.
+.TP
+.B Alt-o
+If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on
+the other panel and moves the selection to the next file.
+.TP
+.B Alt-i
+make the current directory of the current panel also the current
+directory of the other panel.  Put the other panel to the listing mode
+if needed.  If the current panel is panelized, the other panel doesn't
+become panelized.
+.TP
+.B C-PageUp, C-PageDown
+only when supported by the terminal: change to ".." and to the currently
+selected directory respectively.
+.TP
+.B Alt-y
+moves to the previous directory in the history, equivalent to clicking
+the
+.I <
+with the mouse.
+.TP
+.B Alt-u
+moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the
+.I >
+with the mouse.
+.TP
+.B Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H
+displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the 'v' with
+the mouse.
+.\"NODE "  Shell Command Line"
+.SH "  Shell Command Line"
+This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive typing when
+entering shell commands.
+.TP
+.B Alt-Enter
+copy the currently selected file name to the command line.
+.TP
+.B C-Enter
+same a Alt-Enter.  May not work on remote systems and some terminals.
+.TP
+.B C-Shift-Enter
+copy the full path name of the currently selected file to the command
+line.  May not work on remote systems and some terminals.
+.TP
+.B Alt-Tab
+does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname
+.\"LINK2"
+completion
+.\"Completion"
+for you.
+.TP
+.B C-x t, C-x C-t
+copy the tagged files (or if there are no tagged files, the selected
+file) of the current panel (C-x t) or of the other panel (C-x C-t) to
+the command line.
+.TP
+.B C-x p, C-x C-p
+the first key sequence copies the current path name to the command
+line, and the second one copies the unselected panel's path name to
+the command line.
+.TP
+.B C-q
+the quote command can be used to insert characters that are otherwise
+interpreted by the Midnight Commander (like the '+' symbol)
+.TP
+.B Alt-p, Alt-n
+use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you
+to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.
+.TP
+.B Alt-h
+displays the history for the current input line.
+.\"NODE "  General Movement Keys"
+.SH "  General Movement Keys"
+The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use common
+code to handle moving. Therefore they accept exactly the same
+keys. Each of them also accepts some keys of its own.
+.PP
+Other parts of the Midnight Commander use some of the same movement
+keys, so this section may be of use for those parts too.
+.TP
+.B Up, C-p
+moves one line backward.
+.TP
+.B Down, C-n
+moves one line forward.
+.TP
+.B Prev Page, Page Up, Alt-v
+moves one page up.
+.TP
+.B Next Page, Page Down, C-v
+moves one page down.
+.TP
+.B Home, A1
+moves to the beginning.
+.TP
+.B End, C1
+move to the end.
+.PP
+The help viewer and the file viewer accept the following keys in
+addition the to ones mentioned above:
+.TP
+.B b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete
+moves one page up.
+.TP
+.B Space bar
+moves one page down.
+.TP
+.B u, d
+moves one half of a page up or down.
+.TP
+.B g, G
+moves to the beginning or to the end.
+.\"NODE "  Input Line Keys"
+.SH "  Input Line Keys"
+The input lines (they are used for the
+.\"LINK2"
+command line
+.\"Shell Command Line"
+and for the query dialogs in the program) accept these keys:
+.TP
+.B C-a
+puts the cursor at the beginning of line.
+.TP
+.B C-e
+puts the cursor at the end of the line.
+.TP
+.B C-b, move-left
+move the cursor one position left.
+.TP
+.B C-f, move-right
+move the cursor one position right.
+.TP

+.\"Options Menu"
+lists the actions which allow you to customize the Midnight Commander.
+.\"NODE "  Left and Right Menus"
+.SH "  Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus"
+The outlook of the directory panels can be changed from the

+.B Right
+menus (they are named
+.B Above
+and
+.B Below
+when the horizontal panel split is chosen from the
+.\"LINK2"
+Layout
+.\"Layout"
+options dialog).
+.\"NODE "    Listing Mode..."
+.SH "    Listing Mode..."
+The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are
+four different listing modes available:
+.BR Full ,
+.BR Brief ,
+.B Long
+and
+.BR User .
+The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and
+the modification time.
+.PP
+The brief view shows only the file name and it has two columns
+(therefore showing twice as many files as other views). The long view
+is similar to the output of
+.B "ls -l"
+command. The long view takes the whole screen width.
+.PP
+If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify
+the display format.
+.PP
+The user display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This
+may be "half" or "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a
+full screen panel respectively.
+.PP
+After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode on the
+panel, this is done by adding the number "2" to the user format
+string.
+.PP
+After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size
+specifier.  This are the available fields you may display:
+.TP
+.B name
+displays the file name.
+.TP
+.B size
+displays the file size.
+.TP
+.B bsize
+is an alternative form of the
+.B size
+format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just
+shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.
+.TP
+.B type
+displays a one character wide type field.  This character is similar to
+what is displayed by ls with the -F flag -
+.B *
+for executable files,
+.B /
+for directories,
+.B @
+for links,
+.B =
+for sockets,
+.B -
+for character devices,
+.B +
+for block devices,
+.B |
+for pipes,
+.B ~
+for symbolic links to directories and
+.B !
+for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).
+.TP
+.B mark
+an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.
+.TP
+.B mtime
+file's last modification time.
+.TP
+.B atime
+file's last access time.
+.TP
+.B ctime
+file's status change time.
+.TP
+.B perm
+a string representing the current permission bits of the file.
+.TP
+.B mode
+an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.
+.TP
+.B nlink
+the number of links to the file.
+.TP
+.B ngid
+the GID (numeric).
+.TP
+.B nuid
+the UID (numeric).
+.TP
+.B owner
+the owner of the file.
+.TP
+.B group
+the group of the file.
+.TP
+.B inode
+the inode of the file.
+.PP
+Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:
+.TP
+.B space
+a space in the display format.
+.TP
+.B |
+add a vertical line to the display format.
+.PP
+To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add
+.B :
+followed by the number of characters you want the field to have.  If the
+number is followed by the symbol
+.BR + ,
+then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds
+out that there is more space on the screen, it will then expand that
+field.
+.PP
+For example, the
+.B Full
+display corresponds to this format:
+.PP
+half type name | size | mtime
+.PP
+And the
+.B Long
+display corresponds to this format:
+.PP
+full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime
+space name
+.PP
+This is a nice user display format:
+.PP
+half name | size:7 | type mode:3
+.PP
+Panels may also be set to the following modes:
+.TP
+.B "Info"
+The info view display information related to the currently
+selected file and if possible information about the current file
+system.
+.TP
+.B "Tree"
+The tree view is quite similar to the
+.\"LINK2"
+directory tree
+.\"Directory Tree"
+feature. See the section about it for more information.
+.TP
+.B "Quick View"
+In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced
+.\"LINK2"
+viewer
+.\"Internal File Viewer"
+that displays the contents of the currently selected file, if you
+select the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have access
+to the usual viewer commands.
+.\"NODE "    Sort Order..."
+.SH "    Sort Order..."
+The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification time,
+by access time, and by inode information modification time, by size,
+by inode and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you can choose
+the sort order and you may also specify if you want to sort in reverse
+order by checking the reverse box.
+.PP
+By default directories are sorted before files but this can be changed
+from the
+.\"LINK2"
+Options menu
+.\"Options Menu"
+(option
+.BR "Mix all files" ).
+.\"NODE "    Filter..."
+.SH "    Filter..."
+The filter command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example
+.BR "*.tar.gz" )
+which the files must match to be shown. Regardless
+of the filter pattern, the directories and the links to directories
+are always shown in the directory panel.
+.\"NODE "    Reread"
+.SH "    Reread"
+The reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is
+useful if other processes have created or removed files.  If you
+have panelized file names in a panel this will reload the directory
+contents and remove the panelized information (See the section
+.\"LINK2"
+External panelize
+.\"External panelize"
+for more information).
+.\"NODE "  File Menu"
+.SH "  File Menu"
+The Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts
+for commands appearing in the file menu.  The escape sequences for the
+function keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals
+without function key support, you can achieve the same functionality by
+pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0
+(corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).
+.PP
+The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses):
+.PP
+.B Help (F1)
+.PP
+Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the
+.\"LINK2"
+help viewer\&,
+.\"Contents"
+you can use the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to
+follow that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to move
+forward and backward in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full
+list of accepted keys.
+.PP
+.B Menu (F2)
+.PP
+Invoke the
+.\"LINK2"
+user menu\&.
+.\"Menu File Edit"
+The user menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and
+add extra features to the Midnight Commander.
+.PP
+.B View (F3, Shift-F3)
+.PP
+View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the
+.\"LINK2"
+Internal File Viewer
+.\"Internal File Viewer"
+but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes an external
+file viewer specified by the
+.B VIEWER
+environment variable.  If
+.B VIEWER
+is undefined, the
+.B PAGER
+environment variable is tried.  If
+.B PAGER
+is also undefined, the "view" command is invoked.  If you use Shift-F3
+instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or
+preprocessing to the file.
+.PP
+.B Filtered View (Alt-!)
+.PP
+This command prompts for a command
+and its arguments (the argument defaults to the currently selected
+file name), the output from such command is shown in the internal file
+viewer.
+.PP
+.B Edit (F4, F14)
+.PP
+Press F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually Shift-F4)
+to start the editor with a new, empty file.
+Currently they invoke the
+.B vi
+editor, or the editor specified in the
+.B EDITOR
+environment variable, or the
+.\"LINK2"
+Internal File Editor
+.\"Internal File Editor"
+if the use_internal_edit option is on.
+.PP
+.B Copy (F5, F15)
+.PP
+Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or
+the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
+directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination 
+defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. During this
+process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details
+about source mask (which will be usually either * or ^\\(.*\\)$ depending
+on setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination
+see
+.\"LINK2"
+Mask copy/rename\&.
+.\"Mask Copy/Rename"
+.PP
+F15 (usually Shift-F5) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the
+selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of
+any tagged files.
+.PP
+On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by
+clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog
+box).  The
+.\"LINK2"
+Background Jobs
+.\"Background jobs"
+is used to control the background process.
+.PP
+.B Link (C-x l)
+.PP
+Create a hard link to the current file.
+.PP
+.B SymLink (C-x s)
+.PP
+Create a symbolic link to the current file. To those of you who don't
+know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying
+the file, but both the source filename and the destination filename
+represent the same file image. For example, if you edit one of these
+files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some people call
+links aliases or shortcuts.
+.PP
+A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of
+telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete
+either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult
+to notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when
+you don't even want to know.
+.PP
+A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If
+the original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite
+easy to notice that the files represent the same image. The Midnight
+Commander shows an "@"-sign in front of the file name if it is a
+symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)).
+The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status line if the
+.I "Show mini-status"
+option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the
+confusion that can be caused by hard links.
+.PP
+.B Rename/Move (F6, F16)
+.PP
+Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or
+the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
+directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination 
+defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details
+look at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.
+.PP
+F16 (usually Shift-F6) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the
+selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of
+any tagged files.
+.PP
+On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by
+clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog
+box).  The
+.\"LINK2"
+Background Jobs
+.\"Background jobs"
+is used to control the background process.
+.PP
+.B Mkdir (F7)
+.PP
+Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.
+.PP
+.B Delete (F8)
+.PP
+Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the
+currently selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or
+ESC to abort the operation.
+.PP
+.B Quick cd (Alt-c)
+Use the
+.\"LINK2"
+quick cd
+.\"Quick cd"
+command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere.
+.PP
+.B Select group (+)
+.PP
+This is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander
+will prompt for a regular expression describing the group. When
+.I Shell Patterns
+are enabled, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing
+in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing
+for one character). If
+.I Shell Patterns
+is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular
+expressions (see ed (1)).
+.PP
+To mark directories instead of files, the expression must start or end
+with a '/'.
+.PP
+.B Unselect group (\\\\)
+.PP
+Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the
+.I "Select group"
+command.
+.PP
+.B Quit (F10, Shift-F10)
+.PP
+Terminate the Midnight Commander.  Shift-F10 is used when you want to
+quit and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift-F10 will not take you
+to the last directory you visited with the Midnight Commander, instead
+it will stay at the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.
+.\"NODE "    Quick cd"
+.SH "    Quick cd"
+This command is useful if you have a full command line and want to
+.\"LINK2"
+cd
+.\"The cd internal command"
+somewhere without having to yank and paste the command line. This command
+pops up a small dialog, where you enter everything you would enter after
+.B cd
+on the command line and then you press enter. This features all the things
+that are already in the
+.\"LINK2"
+internal cd command\&.
+.\"The cd internal command"
+.\"NODE "  Command Menu"
+.SH "  Command Menu"

+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+Find file
+.\"Find File"
+command allows you to search for a specific file.
+.PP
+The "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.
+.PP
+The "Panels on/off" command shows the output of the last shell command.
+This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.
+.PP
+The Compare directories (C-x d) command compares the directory
+panels with each other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make
+the panels identical. There are three compare methods. The quick method
+compares only file size and file date. The thorough method makes a
+full byte-by-byte compare. The thorough method is not available if the
+machine does not support the mmap(2) system call.  The size-only
+compare method just compares the file sizes and does not check the
+contents or the date times, it just checks the file size.
+.PP
+The Command history command shows a list of typed commands. The
+selected command is copied to the command line. The command history
+can also be accessed by typing Alt-p or Alt-n.
+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+Directory hotlist (C-\\)
+.\"Hotlist"
+command makes changing of the current directory to often used directories
+faster.
+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+External panelize
+.\"External panelize"
+allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that
+program the contents of the current panel.
+.PP
+.\"LINK2"
+Extension file edit
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+command allows you to specify programs to executed when you try to
+execute, view, edit and do a bunch of other thing on files
+with certain extensions (filename endings). The
+.\"LINK2"
+Menu file edit
+.\"Menu File Edit"
+command may be used for editing the user menu (which appears by
+pressing F2).
+.\"NODE "    Directory Tree"
+.SH "    Directory Tree"
+The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories. You
+can select a directory from the figure and the Midnight Commander will
+change to that directory.
+.PP
+There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command
+is available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view
+from the Left or Right menu.
+.PP
+To get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates the tree
+figure by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the
+directory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent
+directory and press C-r (or F2).
+.PP
+You can use the following keys:
+.PP
+.\"LINK2"
+General movement keys
+.\"General Movement Keys"
+are accepted.
+.PP
+.B Enter.
+In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to this
+directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this
+directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the
+current panel.
+.PP
+.B C-r, F2 (Rescan).
+Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date:
+it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which don't
+exist any more.
+.PP
+.B F3 (Forget).
+Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter
+from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree figure
+press F2 in its parent directory.
+.PP
+.B F4 (Static/Dynamic).
+Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static
+navigation mode.
+.PP
+In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to
+select a directory. All known directories are shown.
+.PP
+In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to
+select a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent
+directory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the
+parent, sibling and children directories are shown, others are left
+out. The tree figure changes dynamically as you traverse.
+.PP
+.B F5 (Copy).
+Copy the directory.
+.PP
+.B F6 (RenMov).
+Move the directory.
+.PP
+.B F7 (Mkdir).
+Make a new directory below this directory.
+.PP
+.B F8 (Delete).
+Delete this directory from the file system.
+.PP
+.B C-s, Alt-s.
+Search the next directory matching the search string. If there is
+no such directory these keys will move one line down.
+.PP
+.B C-h, Backspace.
+Delete the last character of the search string.
+.PP
+.B Any other character.
+Add the character to the search string and move to the next directory
+which starts with these characters. In the tree view you must first
+activate the search mode by pressing C-s. The search string is shown

+.PP
+.B F1 (Help).
+Invoke the help viewer and show this section.
+.PP
+.B Esc, F10.
+Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.
+.PP
+The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See
+also the section on
+.\"LINK2"
+mouse support\&.
+.\"Mouse Support"
+.\"NODE "    Find File"
+.SH "    Find File"
+The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the
+search and the filename to be searched for. By pressing the Tree
+button you can select the start directory from the
+.\"LINK2"
+directory tree
+.\"Directory Tree"
+figure.
+.PP
+The contents field accepts regular expressions similar to egrep(1). That
+means you have to escape characters with a special meaning to egrep with "\\",
+e.g. if you search for "strcmp (" you will have to input "strcmp \\("
+(without the double quotes).
+.PP
+You can start the search by pressing the OK button.
+During the search you can stop from the Stop button and continue from
+the Start button.
+.PP
+You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir
+button will change to the directory of the currently selected
+file. The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new
+search. The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize
+button will place the found files to the current directory panel so
+that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move,
+delete and so on). After panelizing you can press C-r to return to the
+normal file listing.
+.PP
+It is possible to have a list of directories that the Find File command
+should skip during the search (for example, you may want to avoid
+searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow
+link).
+.PP
+Directories to be skipped should be set on the variable
+.B find_ignore_dirs
+in the
+.B Misc
+section of your ~/.mc/ini file.
+.PP
+Directory components should be separated with a colon, here is an
+example:
+.PP
+.nf
+[Misc]
+find_ignore_dirs=/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs
+.fi
+.PP
+You may consider using the
+.\"LINK2"
+External panelize
+.\"External panelize"
+command for some operations. Find file command is for simple queries
+only, while using External panelize you can do as mysterious searches
+as you would like.
+.\"NODE "    External panelize"
+.SH "    External panelize"
+The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and
+make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.
+.PP
+For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the
+symbolic links in the current directory, you can use external
+panelization to run the following command:
+.PP
+.nf
+find . -type l -print
+.fi
+.PP
+Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no
+longer be the directory listing of the current directory, but all the
+files that are symbolic links.
+.PP
+If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded
+from your FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file
+name from the transfer log files:
+.PP
+.nf
+awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /usr/adm/xferlog
+.fi
+.PP
+You may want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name,
+so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the command on
+the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name under
+which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that
+command from the list and do not have to type it again.
+.\"NODE "    Hotlist"
+.SH "    Hotlist"
+The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories
+in the directory hotlist.  The Midnight Commander will change to the
+directory corresponding to the selected label.  From the hotlist dialog,
+you can remove already created label/directory pairs and add new ones.
+To add new directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command
+(C-x h), which adds the current directory into the directory hotlist,
+asking just for the label for the directory.
+.PP
+This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the
+CDPATH variable as described in
+.\"LINK2"
+internal cd command
+.\"The cd internal command"
+description.
+.\"NODE "    Extension File Edit"
+.SH "    Extension File Edit"
+This will invoke your editor on the file
+.IR ~/.mc/bindings .
+The format of this file following:
+.PP
+All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.
+.PP
+Lines starting in the first column should have following format:
+.PP
+.IR keyword/expr ,
+i.e. everything after the slash until new line is
+.IR expr .
+.PP
+.I keyword
+can be:
+.TP
+.I shell
+\-
+.I expr
+is an extension (no wildcards).  File matches it its name ends
+with
+.IR expr .
+Example:
+.I shell/.tar

+.IR *.tar .
+.TP
+.I regex
+\-
+.I expr
+is a regular expression.  File matches if its name matches the regular

+\-
+.I expr
+is a regular expression.  File matches if it is a directory and its name
+matches the regular expression.
+.TP

+without the initial "filename:" part matches regular expression
+.IR expr .
+.TP
+.I default
+\- matches any file.
+.I expr
+is ignored.
+.TP
+.I include
+\- denotes a common section.
+.I expr
+is the name of the section.
+.PP
+Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the format:
+.I keyword=command
+(with no spaces around =), where
+.I keyword
+should be:
+.I Open
+(invoked on Enter or double click),
+.I View
+(F3),
+.I Edit
+(F4) or
+.I Include
+(to add rules from the common section).
+.I command
+is any one-line shell command, with the simple
+.\"LINK2"
+macro substitution\&.
+.\"Macro Substitution"
+.PP
+Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is important.  If
+the appropriate action is missing, search continues as if this rule
+didn't match (i.e. if a file matches the first and second entry and View
+action is missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View action
+from the second entry will be used).
+.I default
+should match all the actions.
+.\"NODE "    Background jobs"
+.SH "    Background Jobs"
+This lets you control the state of any background Midnight Commander
+process (only copy and move files operations can be done in the
+background).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from
+here.
+.\"NODE "    Menu File Edit"
+.SH "    Menu File Edit"
+The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by
+the user. When you access the user menu, the
+file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it exists,
+but only if it is owned by user or root and is not world-writable.
+If no such file found, ~/.mc/menu is tried in the same way,
+and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu
+@prefix@/share/mc/mc.menu.
+.PP
+The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with
+anything but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in
+order to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should
+be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are the
+commands that will be executed when the entry is selected.
+.PP
+When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are
+copied to a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually
+/usr/tmp) and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put
+normal shell constructs in the menus. Also simple macro substitution
+takes place before executing the menu code. For more information, see
+.\"LINK2"
+macro substitution\&.
+.\"Macro Substitution"
+.PP
+Here is a sample mc.menu file:
+.PP
+.nf
+A	Dump the currently selected file
+	od -c %f
+
+B	Edit a bug report and send it to root
+	I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1

+X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
+	tar xzvf %f
+.fi
+.PP
+.B Default Conditions
+.PP
+Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must
+start from the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is
+true, the menu entry will be the default entry.
+.PP
+.nf
+Condition syntax: 	= <sub-cond>
+  or:			= <sub-cond> | <sub-cond> ...
+  or:			= <sub-cond> & <sub-cond> ...
+
+Sub-condition is one of following:
+
+  y <pattern>		syntax of current file matching pattern?
+			(for edit menu only)
+  f <pattern>		current file matching pattern?
+  F <pattern>		other file matching pattern?
+  d <pattern>		current directory matching pattern?
+  D <pattern>		other directory matching pattern?
+  t <type>		current file of type?
+  T <type>		other file of type?
+  x <filename>		is it executable filename?
+  ! <sub-cond>		negate the result of sub-condition
+.fi
+.PP
+Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according
+to the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of
+the shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first
+line of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).
+.PP
+Type is one or more of the following characters:
+.PP
+.nf
+  n	not a directory
+  r	regular file
+  d	directory
+  l	link
+  c	character device
+  b	block device
+  f	FIFO (pipe)
+  s	socket
+  x	executable file
+  t	tagged
+.fi
+.PP
+For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't'
+type is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the
+file. The condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the
+current panel and false if not.
+.PP
+If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be
+shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.
+.PP
+The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
+.nf
+	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
+.fi
+is calculated as
+.nf
+	( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)
+.fi
+.PP
+Here is a sample of the use of conditions:
+.PP
+.nf
+= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
+L	List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
+	gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -
+.fi
+.PP
+.B Addition Conditions
+.PP
+If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it
+is an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will
+be included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will
+not be included in the menu.
+.PP
+You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition
+with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you
+want to use two different conditions, one for adding and another for
+defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one
+starting with '+' and another starting with '='.
+.PP
+Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must start
+with '#', space or tab.
+.\"NODE "  Options Menu"

+If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde.
+Otherwise, they won't be shown (like GNU's ls option -B).
+.PP
+.I Show Hidden Files.
+If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show all files that start with
+a dot (like ls -a).
+.PP
+.I Mark moves down.
+If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you mark a file (with

+together.  If the option is off, directories (and links to directories)
+are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files below.
+.PP
+.I Fast directory reload.
+If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander will use a trick to
+determine if the directory contents have changed.  The trick is to reload
+the directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this means
+that reloads only happen when files are created or deleted.  If what
+changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes,
+mode or owner changes, etc) the display is not updated.  In these cases,
+if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory manually
+(with C-r).
+.PP
+.B Pause after run
+.PP
+After executing your commands, the Midnight Commander can pause, so
+that you can examine the output of the command.  There are three
+possible settings for this variable:
+.PP
+.I Never.
+Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If you
+are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to
+see the output of the command by typing C-o.
+.PP
+.I On dumb terminals.
+You will get the pause message on terminals that are not capable of
+showing the output of the last command executed (any terminal that is
+not an xterm or the Linux console).
+.PP
+.I Always.
+The program will pause after executing all of your commands.
+.PP
+.B Other Options
+.PP
+.I Verbose operation.
+This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are
+verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If you have a
+slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is
+automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than
+9600 bps.
+.PP
+.I Compute totals.
+If this option is enabled, the Midnight
+Commander computes total byte sizes and total number of files
+prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This will
+provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense
+of some speed. This option has no effect, if
+.I Verbose operation
+is disabled.
+.PP
+.I Shell Patterns.
+By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like
+regular expressions. The following conversions are performed to achieve
+this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the '?'
+is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the literal
+dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the
+ones described in ed(1).
+.PP
+.I Auto Save Setup.
+If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight Commander the
+configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved in the
+~/.mc/ini file.
+.PP
+.I Auto menus.
+If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup.
+Useful for building menus for non-unixers.
+.PP
+.I Use internal editor.
+If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit
+files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in the
+.B EDITOR
+environment variable is used.
+If no editor is specified,
+.B vi
+is used.  See the section on the
+.\"LINK2"
+internal file editor\&.
+.\"Internal File Editor"
+.PP
+.I Use internal viewer.
+If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view
+files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the
+.B PAGER
+environment variable is used.
+If no pager is specified, the
+.B view
+command is used.  See the section on the
+.\"LINK2"
+internal file viewer\&.
+.\"Internal File Viewer"
+.PP
+.I Complete: show all.
+By default the Midnight Commander pops up all possible
+.\"LINK2"
+completions
+.\"Completion"
+if the completion is ambiguous only when you press
+.B Alt-Tab
+for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much as
+possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if you
+want to see all possible completions even after pressing
+.B Alt-Tab
+the first time.
+.PP
+.I Rotating dash.
+If this option is enabled, the
+Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner
+as a work in progress indicator.
+.PP
+.I Lynx-like motion.
+If this option is enabled,
+you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the
+current selection is a subdirectory and the shell command
+line is empty. By default, this setting is off.
+.PP
+.I Cd follows links.
+This option, if set, causes the Midnight Commander to follow the
+logical chain of directories when changing current directory
+either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default
+behavior of bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows the
+real directory structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory
+through a link will move you to the current directory's real parent
+and not to the directory where the link was present.
+.PP
+.I Safe delete.
+If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries
+unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The default selection in the
+confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from "Yes" to "No".
+This option is disabled by default.
+.\"NODE "    Layout"
+.SH "    Layout"
+The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout
+of screen. You can specify whether the menubar, the command prompt, the
+hintbar and the function keybar are visible. On the Linux or FreeBSD
+console you can specify how many lines are shown in the output window.
+.PP
+The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You
+can specify whether the area is split to the panels in vertical or
+horizontal direction. The split can be equal or you can specify an
+unequal split.
+.PP
+You can specify whether
+.I permissions
+and
+.I file types
+should be highlighted with distinctive
+.\"LINK2"
+Colors\&.
+.\"Colors"
+If the permission highlighting is enabled, the parts of the
+.I perm
+and
+.I mode
+.\"LINK2"
+display fields
+.\"Listing Mode..."
+which apply to the user running Midnight Commander are highlighted with
+the color defined by the
+.I selected
+keyword.  If the file type highlighting is enabled, files are colored
+according to their file type (e.g. directory, core file, executable,
+and so on).
+.PP
+If the
+.I Show Mini-Status
+option is enabled, one line of status information about the currently
+selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels.
+.PP
+When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the
+terminal window title to the current working directory and updates it
+when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is broken and you see some
+incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off the
+.I Xterm Window Title
+option.
+.\"NODE "    Confirmation"
+.SH "    Confirmation"
+In this menu you configure the confirmation options for file deletion,
+directory hotlist entries deletion, overwriting, execution by pressing
+enter and quitting the program.
+.\"NODE "    Display bits"
+.SH "    Display bits"
+This is used to configure the range of visible characters on the
+screen.  This setting may be 7-bits if your terminal/curses supports
+only seven output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the
+ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display
+full 8 bit characters.
+.\"NODE "    Learn keys"
+.SH "    Learn keys"
+This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor
+arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal.
+They often don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken.
+.PP
+You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys ('h'
+left, 'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right).  Once you press any cursor movement
+key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.
+.PP
+You can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a
+key and it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name
+of that key.  Once a key is marked OK it starts working as usually,
+e.g. F1 pressed the first time will just check that the F1 key works,
+but after that it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.
+The Tab key should be working always.
+.PP
+If some keys do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after
+pressing one of these.  Then you may want to redefine it.  Do it by pressing
+the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or by Enter
+or Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then a message
+box will appear asking you to press that key.  Do it and wait until the
+message box disappears.  If you want to abort, just press Escape once
+and wait.
+.PP
+When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions
+for the keys you have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM]
+section of your ~/.mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of your current
+terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were already working properly
+are not saved.
+.\"NODE "    Virtual FS"
+.SH "    Virtual FS"
+This option gives you control over the settings of the
+.\"LINK2"
+Virtual File System\&.
+.\"Virtual File System"
+.PP
+The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some
+of the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the
+file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).
+.PP
+Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example,
+compressed tar files) the Midnight Commander needs to create temporary
+uncompressed files on your disk.
+.PP
+Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk
+take up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached
+information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of
+access to frequently used file systems.
+.PP
+Because of the format of the tar archives, the
+.I Tar filesystem
+needs to read the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most
+tar files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in
+extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk
+in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a
+regular tar file.
+.PP
+Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk,
+it's common that you will leave a tar file and the re-enter it later.
+Since decompression is slow, the Midnight Commander will cache the
+information in memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires, all
+the resources associated with the file system are released.  The default
+timeout is set to one minute.
+.PP
+The
+.\"LINK2"
+FTP File System
+.\"FTP File System"
+(ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote FTP servers.  It has
+several options.
+.PP
+.I ftp anonymous password
+is the password used when you login as "anonymous".  Some sites require
+a valid e-mail address.  On the other hand, you probably don't want to
+give your real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially if you are
+not using spam filtering.
+.PP
+ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache. 
+The cache expire time is configurable with the
+.I ftpfs directory cache timeout
+option.  A low value for this option may slow down every operation on
+the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the
+FTP server.
+.PP
+You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern
+firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so
+FTP proxies are considered obsolete.
+.PP
+If
+.I Always use ftp proxy
+is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain
+hosts.  See
+.\"LINK2"
+FTP File System
+.\"FTP File System"
+for examples.
+.PP
+If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the
+@prefix@/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that
+are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a
+domain) and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are
+directly accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the
+specified FTP proxy.
+.PP
+You can enable using
+.I ~/.netrc
+file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers.  See netrc
+(5) for the description of the .netrc format.
+.PP
+.I Use passive mode
+enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is
+initiated by the client, not by the server.  This option is recommended
+and enabled by default.  If this option is turned off, the data
+connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work with some
+firewalls.
+.\"NODE "    Save Setup"
+.SH "    Save Setup"
+At startup the Midnight Commander will try to load initialization
+information from the ~/.mc/ini file. If this file doesn't exist, it will
+load the information from the system-wide configuration file, located in
+@prefix@/share/mc/mc.ini. If the system-wide configuration file doesn't
+exist, MC uses the default settings.
+.PP
+The
+.I Save Setup

+does some of them:
+.PP
+.I Tilde substitution.
+The (~) will be substituted with your home directory, if you append a

+If the directory specified to the
+.B cd
+command is not in the current directory, then The Midnight Commander
+uses the value in the environment variable
+.B CDPATH
+to search for the directory in any of the named directories.
+.PP
+For example you could set your
+.B CDPATH
+variable to ~/src:/usr/src, allowing you to change your directory to
+any of the directories inside the ~/src and /usr/src directories, from

+.\"NODE "Mask Copy/Rename"
+.SH "Mask Copy/Rename"
+The copy/move operations let you translate the names of files in an
+easy way.  To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and
+usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards.
+All the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to
+the target mask.  If there are tagged files, only the tagged files
+matching the source mask are renamed.
+.PP
+There are other options which you can set:
+.PP
+.B Follow links
+.PP
+determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source
+directory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target
+directory or whether would you like to copy their content.
+.PP
+.B Dive into subdirs
+.PP
+determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied,
+but the target directory already exists.  The default action is to copy
+the contents of the source directory into the target directory. 
+Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into the
+target directory.
+.PP
+For example, you want to copy directory
+.I /foo
+containing file
+.I bar
+to
+.IR /bla/foo ,
+which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when
+.B Dive into subdirs
+is not set), mc would copy file
+.I /foo/bar
+into the file
+.IR /bla/foo/bar .
+By enabling this option the
+.I /bla/foo/foo
+directory will be created, and
+.I /foo/bar
+will be copied into
+.IR /bla/foo/foo/bar .
+.PP
+.B Preserve attributes
+.PP
+determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you
+are root) the ownership of the original files.  If this option is not
+set, the current value of the umask will be respected.
+.PP
+.B Use shell patterns on
+.PP
+When the shell patterns option is on you can use the '*' and '?'
+wildcards in the source mask.  They work like they do in the shell.  In
+the target mask only the '*' and '\\<digit>' wildcards are allowed.  The
+first '*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard
+group in the source mask, the second '*' corresponds to the second group
+and so on.  The '\\1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group
+in the source mask, the '\\2' wildcard corresponds to the second group
+and so on all the way up to '\\9'.  The '\\0' wildcard is the whole
+filename of the source file.
+.PP
+Two examples:
+.PP
+If the source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the
+file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".
+.PP
+Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would
+become "c.file" and so on.  The source mask for this is "*.*" and the
+destination is "\\2.\\1".
+.PP
+.B Use shell patterns off
+.PP
+When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn't do automatic
+grouping anymore. You must use '\\(...\\)' expressions in the source
+mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is
+more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks
+are similar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.
+.PP
+Two examples:
+.PP
+If the source mask is "^\\(.*\\)\\.tar\\.gz$", the destination is
+"/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy
+will be "/bla/foo.tgz".
+.PP
+Let's suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c"
+will become "c.file" and so on. The source mask for this is
+"^\\(.*\\)\\.\\(.*\\)$" and the destination is "\\2.\\1".
+.PP
+.B Case Conversions
+.PP
+You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '\\u'
+or '\\l' in the target mask, the next character will be converted to
+uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.
+.PP
+If you use '\\U' or '\\L' in the target mask, the next characters will
+be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the
+next '\\E' or next '\\U', '\\L' or the end of the file name.
+.PP
+The '\\u' and '\\l' are stronger than '\\U' and '\\L'.
+.PP
+For example, if the source mask is '*' (shell patterns on) or '^\\(.*\\)$'
+(shell patterns off) and the target mask is '\\L\\u*' the file names
+will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case.

+.\"NODE "Internal File Viewer"
+.SH "Internal File Viewer"
+The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex.
+To toggle between modes, use the F4 key.
+.PP
+The viewer will try to use the best method provided by your system or
+the file type to display the information.
+Some character sequences, which appear most often in preformatted manual
+pages, are displayed bold and underlined, thus making a pretty display
+of your files.
+.PP
+When in hex mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and
+constant numbers.  Text in quotes is matched exactly after removing
+the quotes.  Each number matches one byte.  You can mix quoted text
+with constants like this:
+.PP
+.nf
+"String" -1 0xBB 012 "more text"
+.fi
+.PP
+Note that 012 is an octal number.  -1 is converted to 0xFF.
+.PP
+Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that the
+Midnight Commander handles in the internal file viewer.
+.PP
+.B F1
+Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.
+.PP
+.B F2
+Toggle the wrap mode.
+.PP
+.B F4
+Toggle the hex mode.
+.PP
+.B F5
+Goto line.  This will prompt you for a line number and will display
+that line.
+.PP
+.B F6, /.
+Regular expression search.
+.PP
+.B ?,
+Reverse regular expression search.
+.PP
+.B F7

+find next match.
+.PP
+.B C-r.
+Start reverse search if there was no previous search expression else
+find next match.
+.PP
+.B F8
+Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This will show the file as found on disk or if
+a processing filter has been specified in the mc.ext file, then the
+output from the filter. Current mode is always the other than written
+on the button label, since on the button is the mode which you enter
+by that key.
+.PP
+.B F9
+Toggle the format/unformat mode: when format mode is on the viewer
+will interpret some string sequences to show bold and underline with

+It's possible to instruct the file viewer how to display a file, look
+at the
+.\"LINK2"
+Extension File Edit section
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+.\"NODE "Internal File Editor"
+.SH "Internal File Editor"
+The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can
+edit files up to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files. 
+The internal file editor is invoked using
+.B F4
+if the
+.I use_internal_edit
+option is set in the initialization file.
+.PP
+The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut,
+paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro
+commands; regular expression search and replace (and our own
+scanf-printf search and replace); shift-arrow text highlighting (if
+supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap;
+autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file
+types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like
+indent and ispell.
+.PP
+The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what
+keys do what, just consult the appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys
+are: Shift movement keys do text highlighting.
+.B Ctrl-Ins
+copies to the file
+.B cooledit.clip
+and
+.B Shift-Ins
+pastes from cooledit.clip.
+.B Shift-Del
+cuts to
+.BR cooledit.clip ,
+and
+.B Ctrl-Del
+deletes highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works, and you
+can override the mouse as usual by holding down the shift key
+while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse highlighting
+work.
+.PP
+To define a macro, press
+.B Ctrl-R
+and then type out the key
+strokes you want to be executed. Press
+.B Ctrl-R
+again when finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you
+like by pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press
+.B Ctrl-A
+and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed if
+you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the
+key is not used for any other function. Once defined, the macro
+commands go into the file
+.B .mc/cedit/cooledit.macros
+in your home directory. You can delete a macro by deleting the
+appropriate line in this file.
+.PP
+.B F19
+will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or
+.B C
+or
+.B C++
+code or another). This is controlled by the
+file
+.B @prefix@/share/mc/edit.indent.rc
+which is copied to
+.B .mc/cedit/edit.indent.rc
+in your home directory the first time you use it.
+.PP
+You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace
+a C format string. First take a look at the
+.B sscanf
+and
+.B sprintf
+man pages to see what a format string is and how it works.  Consider
+following example.  Suppose you want to replace all occurrences of an
+open bracket, three comma separated numbers, and a close bracket, with
+the word
+.IR apples ,
+the third number, the word
+.I oranges
+and then the second number.  Then fill in the Replace dialog box as
+follows:
+.PP
+.nf
+ Enter search string:
+  (%d,%d,%d)
+ Enter replacement string:
+  apples %d oranges %d
+ Enter replacement argument order:
+  3,2
+.fi
+.PP
+The last line specifies that the third and then the second
+number are to be used in place of the first and second.
+.PP
+It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt on replace on, because
+a match is thought to be found whenever the number of arguments found
+matches the number given, which is not always a real match. Scanf also
+treats whitespace as being elastic.  Note that the scanf format %[ is
+very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.
+.PP
+The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing
+binary files, you should set
+.B display bits
+to 7 bits in the options menu to keep the spacing clean.
+.\"NODE "Completion"
+.SH "Completion"
+Let the Midnight Commander type for you.
+.PP
+Attempt to perform completion on the text before current position.  MC
+attempts completion treating the text as variable (if the text begins
+with
+.BR $ ),
+username (if the text begins with
+.BR ~ ),
+hostname (if the text begins with
+.BR @ )
+or command (if you are on the command line in the position where you
+might type a command, possible completions then include shell reserved
+words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn.  If none of these
+matches, filename completion is attempted.
+.PP
+Filename, username, variable and hostname completion works on all input
+lines, command completion is command line specific.  If the completion
+is ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the
+following action depends on the setting of the
+.I Complete: show all
+option in the
+.\"LINK2"
+Configuration
+.\"Configuration"
+dialog.  If it is enabled, a list of all possibilities pops up next to
+the current position and you can select with the arrow keys and
+.B Enter
+the correct entry.  You can also type the first letters in which the
+possibilities differ to move to a subset of all possibilities and
+complete as much as possible.  If you press
+.B Alt-Tab
+again, only the subset will be shown in the listbox, otherwise the first
+item which matches all the previous characters will be highlighted.  As
+soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by
+canceling keys
+.BR Esc ,
+.B F10
+and left and right arrow keys. If
+.\"LINK2"
+Complete: show all
+.\"Configuration"
+is disabled, the dialog pops up only if you press
+.B Alt-Tab
+for the second time, for the first time MC just beeps.
+.\"NODE "Virtual File System"
+.SH "Virtual File System"
+The Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file
+system; this code layer is known as the virtual file system switch.  The
+virtual file system switch allows the Midnight Commander to manipulate
+files not located on the Unix file system.
+.PP
+Currently the Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File
+Systems (VFS): the
+.I local
+file system, used for accessing the regular Unix file system; the
+.IR ftpfs ,
+used to manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol; the
+.IR tarfs ,
+used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files; the

+used to recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the default file
+system for Linux systems),
+.I fish
+(for manipulating files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh) and
+finally the
+.I mcfs
+(Midnight Commander file system), a network based file system.  If the
+code was compiled with
+.I smbfs
+support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the SMB (CIFS)
+protocol.
+.PP
+A generic
+.I extfs
+(EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand
+VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.
+.PP
+The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will
+forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one
+of the file systems is described later in their own section.
+.\"NODE "  FTP File System"
+.SH "  FTP File System"
+The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote

+command to a path name that looks like this:
+.PP
+.I /#ftp:[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]
+.PP
+The
+.IR user ,
+.I port
+and
+.I remote-dir
+elements are optional.  If you specify the
+.I user
+element, the Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as that
+user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name from the
+.I ~/.netrc
+file.  The optional
+.I pass
+element is the password used for the connection.  Using the password in
+the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the
+screen in clear text and can be saved to the directory history.
+.PP
+To enable using FTP proxy, prepend
+.B !
+(an exclamation sign) to the hostname.
+.PP
+Examples:

+.\"NODE "  Tar File System"
+.SH "  Tar File System"
+The tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar
+files and compressed tar files by using the chdir command.  To change
+your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to the
+tar file by using the following syntax:
+.PP
+.I /filename.tar#utar/[dir-inside-tar]
+.PP
+The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means
+that usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter

+.SH "  EXTernal File System"
+.B extfs
+allows to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight
+Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.
+.PP
+Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:
+.PP
+1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing
+file.  They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree.
+You can invoke them by typing
+.RI ' "cd #fsname" '
+where fsname is an extfs short name (see below).  Examples of such
+filesystems include audio (list audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of
+all Debian packages in the system).
+.PP
+For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type
+.PP
+.nf
+  cd #audio
+.fi
+.PP
+2. 'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent
+contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of 'real' files
+compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages
+in a mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such
+filesystems
+.RI ' #fsname '
+should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the archive itself
+can be on another vfs.
+.PP
+For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type
+.PP
+.nf
+  cd documents.zip#uzip
+.fi
+.PP
+In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For
+instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from directory
+history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell
+commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.
+.PP
+Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:
+.TP
+.B a
+access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette
+.RI ( "cd #a" ).
+.TP
+.B apt
+front end to Debian's APT package management system
+.RI ( "cd #apt" ).
+.TP
+.B audio
+audio CD ripping and playing
+.RI ( "cd #audio"
+or
+.IR "cd device#audio" ).
+.TP
+.B bpp
+package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution
+.RI ( "cd file.bpp#bpp" ).
+.TP
+.B deb
+package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution
+.RI ( "cd file.deb#deb" ).

+.\"NODE "Colors"
+.SH "Colors"
+The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports
+color using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes
+it gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode
+using the -c and -b flag respectively.
+.PP
+If the program is compiled with the Slang screen manager instead of
+ncurses, it will also check the variable
+.B COLORTERM,
+if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c flag.
+.PP
+You may specify terminals that always force color mode
+by adding the
+.I color_terminals
+variable to the Colors section of the initialization file.  This will
+prevent the Midnight Commander from trying to detect if your terminal
+supports color.  Example:
+.PP
+.nf
+[Colors]
+color_terminals=linux,xterm
+color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...
+.fi
+.PP
+The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang, ncurses does
+not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the
+information in the terminal database.
+.PP
+The Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors.
+Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable
+.B MC_COLOR_TABLE
+or the Colors section in the initialization file.
+.PP
+In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the
+.I base_color
+variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal by
+using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:
+.PP
+.nf
+[Colors]
+base_color=
+xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red
+.fi
+.PP
+The format for the color definition is:
+.PP
+.nf
+  <keyword>=<foregroundcolor>,<backgroundcolor>:<keyword>= ...
+.fi
+.PP
+The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, marked,
+markselect, errors, input, reverse, gauge.  Menu colors are: menu,
+menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel.  Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus,
+dhotnormal, dhotfocus.  Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic,
+helpbold, helplink, helpslink.  Viewer color is: viewunderline.  Special
+highlighting colors are: executable, directory, link, stalelink, device,
+special, core.  Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked.
+.PP
+.I input
+determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.
+.PP
+.I gauge
+determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge),
+which is used to show the user the progress of file operations, such as
+copying.
+.PP
+The dialog boxes use the following colors:
+.I dnormal
+is used for the normal text,
+.I dfocus
+is the color used for the currently selected component,
+.I dhotnormal
+is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal
+components, whereas the
+.I dhotfocus
+color is used for the highlighted color in the currently selected
+component.
+.PP
+Menus use the same scheme but uses the menu, menusel, menuhot and

+Most of the settings of the Midnight Commander can be changed from the
+menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be
+changed by editing the setup file.
+.PP
+These variables may be set in your ~/.mc/ini file:
+.TP
+.I clear_before_exec
+By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a
+command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the command at the
+bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.mc/ini file and change the value of
+the field clear_before_exec to 0.
+.TP
+.I confirm_view_dir
+If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If
+this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before changing
+the directory if you have files tagged.
+.TP
+.I ftpfs_retry_seconds
+This value is the number of seconds the Midnight Commander will wait
+before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the
+login.  If the value is zero, the login will no be retried.
+.TP
+.I max_dirt_limit
+Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal
+file viewer.  Normally this value is not significant, because the code
+automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the
+rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on very slow machines or
+terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen
+updates too jumpy.
+.IP
+It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior,
+and that is the default value.
+.TP
+.I mouse_move_pages
+Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by
+line on the panels.
+.TP
+.I mouse_move_pages_viewer
+Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line
+on the internal file viewer.
+.TP
+.I old_esc_mode
+By default the Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix
+(old_esc_mode=0).  If this option is set (old_esc_mode=1), the ESC key
+will act as a prefix key for one second, and if no extra keys have
+arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).
+.TP
+.I only_leading_plus_minus
+Allow special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in the command line (select,
+unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line is empty.  You
+don't need to quote those characters in the middle of the command line.
+On the other hand, you cannot use them to change selection when the
+command line is not empty.
+.TP
+.I panel_scroll_pages
+If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the
+cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, otherwise it
+will just scroll a file at a time.
+.TP
+.I show_output_starts_shell
+This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support.
+When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this
+one is set, you will get a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing any key
+will bring you back to the Midnight Commander.
+.TP
+.I torben_fj_mode
+If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly
+different on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the first
+and last files in the panels, they will act as follows:
+.IP
+The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the
+top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case it will go
+to the first file in the panel.
+.IP
+The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over
+it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom
+line, in such case it will move the selection to the last file name in
+the panel.
+.TP
+.I use_file_to_guess_type
+If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to
+match the file types listed on the
+.\"LINK2"
+mc.ext file\&.
+.\"Extension File Edit"
+.TP
+.I xterm_mode
+If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system
+on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload the other panel with the
+contents of the selected directory.
+.TP
+.I fish_directory_timeout
+This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The
+default value is 900 seconds.
+.\"NODE "Terminal databases"
+.SH "Terminal databases"
+The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal
+database without requiring root privileges.  The Midnight Commander
+searches in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in
+the Midnight Commander library directory) and in the ~/.mc/ini file for
+the section "terminal:your-terminal-name" and then for the section
+"terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that
+you want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the
+key.  You can use the special \\e form to represent the escape character
+and the ^x to represent the control-x character.
+.PP
+The possible key symbols are:
+.PP
+.nf
+f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
+bs            backspace
+home          home key
+end           end key
+up            up arrow key
+down          down arrow key
+left          left arrow key
+right         right arrow key
+pgdn          page down key
+pgup          page up key
+insert        the insert character
+delete        the delete character
+complete      to do completion
+.fi
+.PP
+For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you
+set this in the ini file:
+.PP
+.nf
+insert=\\e[Op
+.fi
+.PP
+The
+.I complete
+key symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion
+process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do
+the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys
+everywhere).

+.TH MCEDIT 1 "September 2007" "MC Version 4.6.2-pre1" "GNU Midnight Commander"
+.SH NAME
+mcedit \- Internal file editor of GNU Midnight Commander.
+.SH USAGE
+.B mcedit
+[\-bcCdfhstVx?] [+lineno] file
+.PP
+.B mcedit
+[\-bcCdfhstVx?] file:lineno[:]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+mcedit is a link to
+.BR mc ,
+the main GNU Midnight Commander executable.  Executing GNU Midnight
+Commander under this name requests staring the internal editor and
+opening the
+.I file
+specified on the command line.  The editor is based on the terminal
+version of
+.B cooledit
+\- standalone editor for X Window System.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.I "+lineno"
+Go to the line specified by number (do not put a space between the
+.I "+"
+sign and the number).
+.TP
+.I "\-b"
+Force black and white display.
+.TP
+.I "\-c"
+Force ANSI color mode on terminals that don't seem to have color
+support.
+.TP
+.I "\-C <keyword>=<FGcolor>,<BGcolor>:<keyword>= ..."
+Specify a different color set.  See the
+.B Colors
+section in mc(1) for more information.
+.TP
+.I "\-d"
+Disable mouse support.
+.TP
+.I "\-f"
+Display the compiled-in search path for GNU Midnight Commander data
+files.
+.TP
+.I "\-t"
+Force using termcap database instead of terminfo.  This option is only
+applicable if GNU Midnight Commander was compiled with S-Lang library
+with terminfo support.
+.TP
+.I "\-V"
+Display the version of the program.
+.TP
+.I "\-x"
+Force xterm mode.  Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (two
+screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).
+.SH FEATURES
+The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can
+edit files up to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files. 
+The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut,
+paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro
+commands; regular expression search and replace (and our own
+scanf-printf search and replace); shift-arrow text highlighting (if
+supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap;
+autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file
+types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like
+indent and ispell.
+.SH KEYS
+The editor is easy to use and can be used without learning.  The
+pull-down menu is invoked by pressing F9.  You can learn other keys from
+the menu and from the button bar labels.
+.PP
+In addition to that, Shift combined with arrows does text highlighting
+(if supported by the terminal):
+.B Ctrl-Ins
+copies to the file
+.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip ,
+.B Shift-Ins
+pastes from
+.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip ,
+.B Shift-Del
+cuts to
+.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip ,
+and
+.B Ctrl-Del
+deletes highlighted text.  Mouse highlighting also works on some
+terminals.  To use the standard mouse support provided by your terminal,
+hold the Shift key.  Please note that the mouse support in the terminal
+doesn't share the clipboard with
+.BR mcedit .
+.PP
+The completion key (usually
+.B "Alt-Tab"
+or
+.BR "Escape Tab" )
+completes the word under the cursor using the words used earlier in the
+file.
+.PP
+To define a macro, press
+.B Ctrl-R
+and then type out the keys you want to be executed.  Press
+.B Ctrl-R
+again when finished.  You can then assign the macro to any key you like
+by pressing that key.  The macro is executed when you press
+.B Ctrl-A
+and then the assigned key.  The macro is also executed if you press
+Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not
+used for any other function.  The macro commands are stored in the file
+.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.macros .
+Do NOT edit this file if you are going to use macros again in the same
+editing session, because
+.B mcedit
+caches macro key defines in memory.
+.B mcedit
+now overwrites a macro if a macro with the same key already exists,
+so you won't have to edit this file. You will also have to restart
+other running editors for macros to take effect.
+.P
+.B F19
+will format C, C++, Java or HTML code when it is highlighted.  An executable
+file called
+.B ~/.mc/cedit/edit.indent.rc
+will be created for you from the default template.  Feel free to edit it
+if you need.
+.PP
+.B C-p
+will run ispell on a block of text in a similar way.  The script file
+will be called
+.BR ~/.mc/cedit/edit.spell.rc .
+.PP
+If some keys don't work, you can use
+.B Learn Keys
+in the
+.B Options
+menu.
+.SH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
+.B mcedit
+supports syntax highlighting.  This means that keywords and contexts
+(like C comments, string constants, etc) are highlighted in different
+colors.  The following section explains the format of the file
+.BR ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax .
+If this file is missing, system-wide
+.B @prefix@/share/mc/syntax/Syntax
+is used.
+The file
+.B ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax
+is rescanned on opening of a any new editor file.  The file contains
+rules for highlighting, each of which is given on a separate line, and
+define which keywords will be highlighted to what color.
+.PP
+The file is divided into sections, each beginning with a line with the
+.B file
+command.  The sections are normally put into separate files using the
+.B include
+command.
+.PP
+The
+.B file
+command has three arguments.  The first argument is a regular expression
+that is applied to the file name to determine if the following section
+applies to the file.  The second argument is the description of the file
+type.  It is used in
+.BR cooledit ;
+future versions of
+.B mcedit
+may use it as well.  The third optional argument is a regular expression
+to match the first line of text of the file.  The rules in the following
+section apply if either the file name or the first line of text matches.
+.PP
+A section ends with the start of another section.  Each section is
+divided into contexts, and each context contains rules.  A context is a
+scope within the text that a particular set of rules belongs to.  For
+instance, the text within a C style comment (i.e. between
+.B /*
+and
+.BR */ )
+has its own color.  This is a context, although it has no further rules
+inside it because there is probably nothing that we want highlighted
+within a C comment.
+.PP
+A trivial C programming section might look like this:
+.PP
+.nf
+file .\\*\\\\.c C\\sProgram\\sFile (#include|/\\\\\\*)
+
+wholechars abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_
+
+# default colors
+define  comment   brown
+context default
+  keyword  whole  if       yellow
+  keyword  whole  else     yellow
+  keyword  whole  for      yellow
+  keyword  whole  while    yellow
+  keyword  whole  do       yellow
+  keyword  whole  switch   yellow
+  keyword  whole  case     yellow
+  keyword  whole  static   yellow
+  keyword  whole  extern   yellow
+  keyword         {        brightcyan
+  keyword         }        brightcyan
+  keyword         '*'      green
+
+# C comments
+context /\\* \\*/ comment
+
+# C preprocessor directives
+context linestart # \\n red
+  keyword  \\\\\\n  brightred
+
+# C string constants
+context " " green
+  keyword  %d    brightgreen
+  keyword  %s    brightgreen
+  keyword  %c    brightgreen
+  keyword  \\\\"   brightgreen
+.fi
+.PP
+Each context starts with a line of the form:
+.PP
+.B context
+.RB [ exclusive ]
+.RB [ whole | wholeright | wholeleft ]
+.RB [ linestart ]
+.I delim
+.RB [ linestart ]
+.I delim
+.RI [ foreground ]
+.RI [ background ]
+.PP
+The first context is an exception.  It must start with the command
+.PP
+.B context default
+.RI [ foreground ]
+.RI [ background ]
+.PP
+otherwise
+.B mcedit
+will report an error.  The
+.B linestart
+option specifies that
+.I delim
+must start at the beginning of a line.  The
+.B whole
+option tells that
+.I delim
+must be a whole word.  To specify that a word must begin on the word
+boundary only on the left side, you can use the
+.B wholeleft
+option, and similarly a word that must end on the word boundary is specified by
+.BR wholeright .
+.PP
+The set of characters that constitute a whole word can be changed at any
+point in the file with the
+.B wholechars
+command.  The left and right set of characters can be set separately
+with
+.PP
+.B wholechars
+.RB [ left | right ]
+.I characters
+.PP
+The
+.B exclusive
+option causes the text between the delimiters to be highlighted, but not
+the delimiters themselves.
+.PP
+Each rule is a line of the form:
+.PP
+.B keyword
+.RB [ whole | wholeright | wholeleft ]
+.RB [ linestart ]
+.I string foreground
+.RI [ background ]
+.PP
+Context or keyword strings are interpreted, so that you can include tabs
+and spaces with the sequences \\t and \\s.  Newlines and backslashes are
+specified with \\n and \\\\ respectively.  Since whitespace is used as a
+separator, it may not be used as is.  Also, \\* must be used to specify
+an asterisk.  The * itself is a wildcard that matches any length of
+characters.  For example,
+.PP
+.nf
+  keyword         '*'      green
+.fi
+.PP
+colors all C single character constants green.  You also could use
+.PP
+.nf
+  keyword         "*"      green
+.fi
+.PP
+to color string constants, but the matched string would not be allowed
+to span across multiple newlines.  The wildcard may be used within
+context delimiters as well, but you cannot have a wildcard as the last
+or first character.
+.PP
+Important to note is the line
+.PP
+.nf
+  keyword  \\\\\\n  brightgreen
+.fi
+.PP
+This line defines a keyword containing the backslash and newline
+characters.  Since the keywords are matched before the context
+delimiters, this keyword prevents the context from ending at the end of
+the lines that end in a backslash, thus allowing C preprocessor
+directive to continue across multiple lines.
+.PP
+The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green,
+brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta,
+cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white.  If the syntax file is shared
+with
+.BR cooledit ,
+it is possible to specify different colors for
+.B mcedit
+and
+.B cooledit
+by separating them with a slash, e.g.
+.PP
+.nf
+keyword  #include  red/Orange
+.fi
+.PP
+.B mcedit
+uses the color before the slash.  See cooledit(1) for supported
+.B cooledit
+colors.
+.PP
+Comments may be put on a separate line starting with the hash sign (#).
+.PP
+Because of the simplicity of the implementation, there are a few
+intricacies that will not be dealt with correctly but these are a minor
+irritation.  On the whole, a broad spectrum of quite complicated
+situations are handled with these simple rules.  It is a good idea to
+take a look at the syntax file to see some of the nifty tricks you can
+do with a little imagination.  If you cannot get by with the rules I
+have coded, and you think you have a rule that would be useful, please
+email me with your request.  However, do not ask for regular expression
+support, because this is flatly impossible.
+.PP
+A useful hint is to work with as much as possible with the things you
+can do rather than try to do things that this implementation cannot deal
+with.  Also remember that the aim of syntax highlighting is to make
+programming less prone to error, not to make code look pretty.
+.SH COLORS
+The default colors may be changed by appending to the
+.B MC_COLOR_TABLE
+environment variable.  Foreground and background colors pairs may be
+specified for example with:
+.PP
+.nf
+MC_COLOR_TABLE="$MC_COLOR_TABLE:\\
+editnormal=lightgray,black:\\
+editbold=yellow,black:\\
+editmarked=black,cyan"
+.fi
+.SH OPTIONS
+Most options can now be set from the editors options dialog box.  See
+the
+.B Options
+menu.  The following options are defined in
+.B ~/.mc/ini
+and have obvious counterparts in the dialog box.  You can modify them to
+change the editor behavior, by editing the file.  Unless specified, a 1
+sets the option to on, and a 0 sets it to off, as is usual.
+.TP
+.I use_internal_edit
+This option is ignored when invoking
+.BR mcedit .
+.TP
+.I editor_key_emulation
+1 for
+.B Emacs
+keys, and 0 for normal
+.B Cooledit
+keys.
+.TP
+.I editor_tab_spacing
+Interpret the tab character as being of this length.
+Default is 8. You should avoid using
+other than 8 since most other editors and text viewers
+assume a tab spacing of 8. Use
+.B editor_fake_half_tabs
+to simulate a smaller tab spacing.
+.TP
+.I editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces
+Never insert a tab space. Rather insert spaces (ascii 20h) to fill to the
+desired tab size.
+.TP
+.I editor_return_does_auto_indent
+Pressing return will tab across to match the indentation
+of the first line above that has text on it.
+.TP
+.I editor_backspace_through_tabs
+Make a single backspace delete all the space to the left
+margin if there is no text between the cursor and the left
+margin.
+.TP
+.I editor_fake_half_tabs
+This will emulate a half tab for those who want to program
+with a tab spacing of 4, but do not want the tab size changed
+from 8 (so that the code will be formatted the same when displayed
+by other programs). When editing between text and the left
+margin, moving and tabbing will be as though a tab space were
+4, while actually using spaces and normal tabs for an optimal fill.
+When editing anywhere else, a normal tab is inserted.
+.TP
+.I editor_option_save_mode
+Possible values 0, 1 and 2.  The save mode (see the options menu also)
+allows you to change the method of saving a file.  Quick save (0) saves
+the file by immediately, truncating the disk file to zero length (i.e.
+erasing it) and the writing the editor contents to the file.  This
+method is fast, but dangerous, since a system error during a file save
+will leave the file only partially written, possibly rendering the data
+irretrievable.  When saving, the safe save (1) option enables creation
+of a temporary file into which the file contents are first written.  In
+the event of an problem, the original file is untouched.  When the
+temporary file is successfully written, it is renamed to the name of the
+original file, thus replacing it.  The safest method is create backups
+(2).  Where a backup file is created before any changes are made.  You
+can specify your own backup file extension in the dialog.  Note that
+saving twice will replace your backup as well as your original file.
+.SH MISCELLANEOUS
+You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace a C format
+string.  First take a look at the
+.B sscanf
+and
+.B sprintf
+man pages to see what a format string is and how it works.  Here's an
+example: suppose that you want to replace all occurrences of an open
+bracket, three comma separated numbers, and a close bracket, with the
+word
+.IR apples ,
+the third number, the word
+.I oranges
+and then the second number.  You would fill in the Replace dialog box as
+follows:
+.PP
+.nf
+.B Enter search string
+(%d,%d,%d)
+.B Enter replace string
+apples %d oranges %d
+.B Enter replacement argument order
+3,2
+.fi
+.PP
+The last line specifies that the third and then the second number are to
+be used in place of the first and second.
+.PP
+It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt On Replace on, because a
+match is thought to be found whenever the number of arguments found
+matches the number given, which is not always a real match. Scanf also
+treats whitespace as being elastic.  Note that the scanf format %[ is
+very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.
+.PP
+The editor also displays non-us characters (160+).  When editing
+binary files, you should set
+.B display bits
+to 7 bits in the Midnight Commander options menu to keep the spacing
+clean.

+.SH NAME
+mcserv \- Midnight Commander file server.
+.SH USAGE
+.B mcserv
+[\-diqvf] [\-p portnum]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+mcserv is the server program for the Midnight Commander networking
+file system.  It provides access to the host file system to clients
+running the Midnight file system (currently, only the Midnight
+Commander file manager).
+.PP
+If the program is run as root the program will try to get a reserved
+port otherwise it will use 9876 as the port.
+.PP
+If the system has a portmapper running, then the port will be
+registered with the portmapper and thus clients will automatically
+connect to the right port.  If the system does not have a portmapper,
+then a port should be manually specified with the -p option (see
+below). 
+.PP
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.I "-d"
+Become a daemon, you should use this flag if you start the program
+from one of the system startup files.  This flag will make the program
+handle any number of incoming requests by forking a new copy of itself
+for each client.
+.TP
+.I "-q"
+Quiet mode.
+.TP
+.I "-p"
+To make the server listen on the specified 
+.B portnum
+port.
+.TP
+.I "-f"
+Allow ftp authentication as a fallback if the other methods fail.
+This is only useful on systems where the password checking method is not
+supported by this version of mcserv.  The local ftp server is contacted
+with the username and password.  The user is authenticated if the ftp
+server accepts the credentials.  Use this option with care and only
+when necessary.
+.TP
+.I "-v"
+Toggle on the verbose mode.
+.SH LICENSE
+This program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
+License as published by the Free Software Foundation. See the built-in
+help for details on the License and the lack of warranty.
+.SH BUGS
+This program currently uses port 9876, and not a system secure port.
+This is a potential security problem since it could be run by any user

+.SH NAME
+mcview \- Internal file viewer of GNU Midnight Commander.
+.SH USAGE
+.B mcview
+[-bcCdfhstVx?] file
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+mcview is a link to
+.BR mc ,
+the main GNU Midnight Commander executable.  Executing GNU Midnight
+Commander under this name requests staring the internal viewer and
+opening the
+.I file
+specified on the command line.

+Specify a different color set.  See the
+.B Colors
+section in mc(1) for more information.
+.TP
+.I "\-d"
+Disable mouse support.
+.TP
+.I "\-f"
+Display the compiled-in search paths for Midnight Commander files.
+.TP
+.I "\-t"
+Used only if the code was compiled with S-Lang and terminfo: it makes

+variable for the terminal information instead of the information on
+the system wide terminal database
+.TP
+.I "\-V"
+Displays the version of the program.
+.TP
+.I "\-x"
+Forces xterm mode.  Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (two
+screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).
+.PP
+.SH COLORS
+The default colors may be changed by appending to the
+.B MC_COLOR_TABLE
+environment variable.  Foreground and background colors pairs may be
+specified for example with:

+.PP
+Jeli wybrano, pierwszy katalog uywany jest do wywietlenia w pierwszym panelu.
+Drugi wywietlany jest w drugim panelu.
+.\"NODE "Overview"
+.SH Opis
+Ekran Midnight Commandera podzielony jest na cztery czci. Prawie cay obszar
+ekranu zajmuj dwa panele. Standardowo przedostatnia od dou linijka ekranu,
+przeznaczona jest do wpisywania polece, a ostatnia pokazuje klawisze funkcyjne.
+Najwyszy wiersz jest wierszem menu. Moe on by niewidoczny, ale pojawia si zawsze
+po klikniciu w najwysz lini ekranu, albo po wciniciu klawisza F9.
+.PP
+Midnight Commander pozwala na ogldanie dwch paneli w tym samym czasie.
+Jeden z nich jest panelem aktywnym (podwietlona linia wyboru znajduje si wanie
+w nim). Niemal wszystkie operacje wykonuje si na panelu aktywnym.
+Niektre operacje, jak
+np. kopiowanie, zmiana nazwy uywaj jako domylnego miejsca docelowego
+katalogu otwartego w panelu nieaktywnym
+(nie martw si, zawsze zostaniesz poproszony o
+potwierdzenie takiej operacji). W celu zasignicia szerszych informacji zajrzyj
+do dziaw
+.BR "Panele katalogw" , " Lewe i prawe menu " oraz " Menu plikw" .
+.PP
+Moesz wywoywa dowolne komendy systemowe po prostu wpisujc je. Wszystko co
+piszesz pojawia si w linii polece i po naciniciu klawisza Enter zostanie
+wykonane przez Midnight Commandera. Przeczytaj sekcj
+.BR "Linia powoki i Linia wejciowa klawiszy" ,
+eby nauczy si wicej na ten temat.
+.PP
+.\"NODE "Mouse Support"
+.SH "Obsuga myszy"
+Midnight Commander obsuguje mysz. Modu ten jest uruchamiany wtedy kiedy
+korzystasz z terminala
+.BR xterm (1)
+(dziaa nawet wtedy, kiedy czysz si przez telnet albo rlogin z innym komputerem
+z terminala xterm) lub jeli korzystasz z linuksa na konsoli z zainstalowanym
+serwerem
+.BR gpm (1).
+.PP
+Kiedy klikniesz lewym przyciskiem na panel z katalogami, plik zostanie
+wybrany jako aktywny; jeli klikniesz prawym przyciskiem zostanie on
+zaznaczony [lub odznaczony - w zalenoci od jego aktualnego stanu -
+dziaanie podobne do klawisza
+.B Insert
+- przyp. tumacza].
+.PP
+Podwjne kliknicie w plik spowoduje wykonanie pliku, jeli jest on wykonywalny,
+a jeli rozszerzenie pliku jest rozpoznawane przez Midnight Commander'a i dostpny
+jest odpowiedni program, jest on uruchamiany.
+.PP
+Moliwe jest rwnie wykonywanie komend przypisanych klawiszom funkcyjnym
+przez kliknicie w nie.
+.PP
+Jeli kliknicie odbdzie si w rejonie grnej lini panelu z katalogami, zostanie
+on przewinity jedn stron wstecz. Podobnie kliknicie na doln ramk przewija
+tekst jedn stron do przodu. Ta opcja klikania w ramki dziaa rwnie przy
+przegldaniu pomocy i przy drzewie katalogw.
+.PP
+Standardowo czas autopowtrzenia przy klikaniu mysz wynosi 400 milisekund.
+T warto mona zmieni edytujc plik

+.IR mouse_repeat_rate .
+.PP
+Jeli uywasz Midnight Commandera z obsug myszy, moesz "przeszczepia"
+kawaki tekstw i uywa standardowych zastosowa myszki (kopiowanie i
+wklejanie) za pomoc klawisza Shift.
+.SH ""
+.\"NODE "Keys"
+.SH "Klawisze"
+Niektre komendy Midnight Commandera wywouje si kombinacj klawiszy
+.I Control
+(czasem opisywanego jako CTRL lub CTL) lub
+.I Meta
+(opisywanego ALT lub nawet Compose). W tym manualu (pliku pomocy) bdziemy
+uywa nastpujcych kombinacji:

-.\"Colors"
-section.
-.TP
-.I \-d, \-\-nomouse
-Disable mouse support.
-.TP
-.I \-e [file], \-\-edit[=file]
-Start the internal editor.  If the file is specified, open it on

-.BR "mcedit (1)" .
-.TP
-.I \-f, \-\-datadir
-Display the compiled-in search paths for Midnight Commander files.
-.TP
-.I \-k, \-\-resetsoft
-Reset softkeys to their default from the termcap/terminfo
-database. Only useful on HP terminals when the function keys don't work.
-.TP
-.I \-l file, \-\-ftplog=file
-Save the ftpfs dialog with the server in file.
-.TP
-.I \-P file, \-\-printwd=file
-Print the last working directory to the specified file.  This option is
-not meant to be used directly.  Instead, it's used from a special shell
-script that automatically changes the current directory of the shell to
-the last directory the Midnight Commander was in.  Source the file
-.B @prefix@/share/mc/bin/mc.sh
-(bash and zsh users) or
-.B @prefix@/share/mc/bin/mc.csh
-(tcsh users) respectively to define
-.B mc
-as an alias to the appropriate shell script.
-.TP
-.I \-s, \-\-slow
-Turn on the slow terminal mode, in this mode the program will not
-draw expensive line drawing characters and will toggle verbose mode
-off.
-.TP
-.I \-t, \-\-termcap
-Used only if the code was compiled with Slang and terminfo: it makes
-the Midnight Commander use the value of the
-.B TERMCAP
-variable for the terminal information instead of the information on
-the system wide terminal database
-.TP
-.I \-u, \-\-nosubshell
-Disable use of the concurrent shell (only makes sense if the Midnight
-Commander has been built with concurrent shell support).
-.TP
-.I \-U, \-\-subshell
-Enable use of the concurrent shell support (only makes sense if the
-Midnight Commander was built with the subshell support set as an
-optional feature).
-.TP
-.I \-v file, \-\-view=file
-Start the internal viewer to view the specified file.  See also
-.BR "mcview (1)" .
-.TP
-.I \-V, \-\-version
-Display the version of the program.
-.TP
-.I \-x, \-\-xterm
-Force xterm mode.  Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (two
-screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).
-.PP
-If specified, the first path name is the directory to show in the
-selected panel; the second path name is the directory to be shown in
-the other panel.
-.\"NODE "Overview"
-.SH "Overview"
-The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into four parts.
-Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels.
-By default, the second line from the bottom of the screen is the
-shell command line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels.
-The topmost line is the
-.\"LINK2"
-menu bar line\&.
-.\"Menu Bar"
-The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the
-topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key.
-.PP
-The Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same
-time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in
-the current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current
-panel. Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the
-directory of the unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they
-always ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the
-sections on the
-.\"LINK2"
-Directory Panels\&,
-.\"Directory Panels"
-the
-.\"LINK2"
-Left and Right Menus
-.\"Left and Right Menus"
-and the
-.\"LINK2"
-File Menu\&.
-.\"File Menu"
-.PP
-You can execute system commands from the Midnight Commander by simply
-typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line,
-and when you press Enter the Midnight Commander will execute the
-command line you typed; read the
-.\"LINK2"
-Shell Command Line
-.\"Shell Command Line"
-and
-.\"LINK2"
-Input Line Keys
-.\"Input Line Keys"
-sections to learn more about the command line.
-.\"NODE "Mouse Support"
-.SH "Mouse Support"
-The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support.  It is activated
-whenever you are running on an
-.B xterm(1)
-terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to
-another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on a Linux
-console and have the
-.B gpm
-mouse server running.
-.PP
-When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is
-selected; if you click with the right button, the file is marked (or
-unmarked, depending on the previous state).
-.PP
-Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is
-an executable program; and if the
-.\"LINK2"
-extension file
-.\"Extension File Edit"
-has a program specified for the file's extension, the specified
-program is executed.
-.PP
-Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function
-key labels by clicking on them.
-.PP
-If a mouse button is clicked on the top frame line of the directory panel,
-it is scrolled one page up.  Likewise, a click on the bottom frame line
-will cause scrolling one page down.  This frame line method works also
-in the
-.\"LINK2"
-Help Viewer
-.\"Contents"
-and the
-.\"LINK2"
-Directory Tree\&.
-.\"Directory Tree"
-.PP
-The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400
-milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by editing the
-.\"LINK2"
-\&~/.mc/ini
-.\"Save Setup"
-file and changing the
-.I mouse_repeat_rate
-parameter.
-.PP
-If you are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you
-can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding
-down the Shift key.
-.SH ""
-.\"NODE "Keys"
-.SH "Keys"
-Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of the
-.I Control
-(sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the
-.I Meta
-(sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this manual we will
-use the following abbreviations:
-.TP
-.B C-<chr>
-means hold the Control key while typing the character <chr>.
-Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.
-.TP
-.B Alt-<chr>
-means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing <chr>.
-If there is no Meta or Alt key, type
-.IR ESC , 
-release it, then type the character <chr>.
-.TP
-.B S-<chr>
-means hold the Shift key down while typing <chr>.
-.PP
-All input lines in the Midnight Commander use an approximation to
-the GNU Emacs editor's key bindings.
-.PP
-There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are
-the most important.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-File Menu
-.\"File Menu"
-section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in
-the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of these
-commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the
-tagged files.

-.\"NODE "    Listing Mode..."
-.SH "    Listing Mode..."
-The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are
-four different listing modes available:
-.BR Full ,
-.BR Brief ,
-.B Long
-and
-.BR User .
-The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and
-the modification time.
-.PP
-The brief view shows only the file name and it has two columns
-(therefore showing twice as many files as other views). The long view
-is similar to the output of
-.B "ls -l"
-command. The long view takes the whole screen width.
-.PP
-If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify
-the display format.
-.PP
-The user display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This
-may be "half" or "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a
-full screen panel respectively.
-.PP
-After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode on the
-panel, this is done by adding the number "2" to the user format
-string.
-.PP
-After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size
-specifier.  This are the available fields you may display:
-.TP
-.B name
-displays the file name.
-.TP
-.B size
-displays the file size.
-.TP
-.B bsize
-is an alternative form of the
-.B size
-format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just
-shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.
-.TP
-.B type
-displays a one character wide type field.  This character is similar to
-what is displayed by ls with the -F flag -
-.B *
-for executable files,
-.B /
-for directories,
-.B @
-for links,
-.B =
-for sockets,
-.B -
-for character devices,
-.B +
-for block devices,
-.B |
-for pipes,
-.B ~
-for symbolic links to directories and
-.B !
-for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).
-.TP
-.B mark
-an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.
-.TP
-.B mtime
-file's last modification time.
-.TP
-.B atime
-file's last access time.
-.TP
-.B ctime
-file's status change time.
-.TP
-.B perm
-a string representing the current permission bits of the file.
-.TP
-.B mode
-an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.
-.TP
-.B nlink
-the number of links to the file.
-.TP
-.B ngid
-the GID (numeric).
-.TP
-.B nuid
-the UID (numeric).
-.TP
-.B owner
-the owner of the file.
-.TP
-.B group
-the group of the file.
-.TP
-.B inode
-the inode of the file.
-.PP
-Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:
-.TP
-.B space
-a space in the display format.
-.TP
-.B |
-add a vertical line to the display format.
-.PP
-To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add
-.B :
-followed by the number of characters you want the field to have.  If the
-number is followed by the symbol
-.BR + ,
-then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds
-out that there is more space on the screen, it will then expand that
-field.
-.PP
-For example, the
-.B Full
-display corresponds to this format:
-.PP
-half type name | size | mtime
-.PP
-And the
-.B Long
-display corresponds to this format:
-.PP
-full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime
-space name
-.PP
-This is a nice user display format:
-.PP
-half name | size:7 | type mode:3
-.PP
-Panels may also be set to the following modes:
-.TP
-.B "Info"
-The info view display information related to the currently
-selected file and if possible information about the current file
-system.
-.TP
-.B "Tree"
-The tree view is quite similar to the
-.\"LINK2"
-directory tree
-.\"Directory Tree"

-.TP
-.B "Quick View"
-In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced
-.\"LINK2"

-by access time, and by inode information modification time, by size,
-by inode and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you can choose
-the sort order and you may also specify if you want to sort in reverse
-order by checking the reverse box.
-.PP
-By default directories are sorted before files but this can be changed
-from the
-.\"LINK2"
-Options menu
-.\"Options Menu"
-(option
-.BR "Mix all files" ).
-.\"NODE "    Filter..."
-.SH "    Filter..."
-The filter command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example
-.BR "*.tar.gz" )
-which the files must match to be shown. Regardless
-of the filter pattern, the directories and the links to directories
-are always shown in the directory panel.
-.\"NODE "    Reread"
-.SH "    Reread"
-The reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is
-useful if other processes have created or removed files.  If you
-have panelized file names in a panel this will reload the directory
-contents and remove the panelized information (See the section
-.\"LINK2"
-External panelize
-.\"External panelize"
-for more information).
-.\"NODE "  File Menu"
-.SH "  File Menu"
-The Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts
-for commands appearing in the file menu.  The escape sequences for the
-function keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals
-without function key support, you can achieve the same functionality by
-pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0
-(corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).
-.PP
-The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses):
-.PP
-.B Help (F1)
-.PP
-Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the
-.\"LINK2"
-help viewer\&,
-.\"Contents"
-you can use the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to
-follow that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to move
-forward and backward in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full
-list of accepted keys.
-.PP
-.B Menu (F2)
-.PP
-Invoke the
-.\"LINK2"
-user menu\&.
-.\"Menu File Edit"
-The user menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and
-add extra features to the Midnight Commander.
-.PP
-.B View (F3, Shift-F3)
-.PP
-View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the
-.\"LINK2"
-Internal File Viewer
-.\"Internal File Viewer"
-but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes an external
-file viewer specified by the
-.B VIEWER
-environment variable.  If
-.B VIEWER
-is undefined, the
-.B PAGER
-environment variable is tried.  If
-.B PAGER
-is also undefined, the "view" command is invoked.  If you use Shift-F3
-instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or
-preprocessing to the file.
-.PP
-.B Filtered View (Alt-!)
-.PP
-This command prompts for a command
-and its arguments (the argument defaults to the currently selected
-file name), the output from such command is shown in the internal file
-viewer.
-.PP
-.B Edit (F4, F14)
-.PP
-Press F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually Shift-F4)
-to start the editor with a new, empty file.
-Currently they invoke the
-.B vi
-editor, or the editor specified in the
-.B EDITOR
-environment variable, or the
-.\"LINK2"
-Internal File Editor
-.\"Internal File Editor"
-if the use_internal_edit option is on.
-.PP
-.B Copy (F5, F15)
-.PP
-Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or
-the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
-directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination 
-defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. During this
-process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details
-about source mask (which will be usually either * or ^\\(.*\\)$ depending
-on setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination
-see
-.\"LINK2"
-Mask copy/rename\&.
-.\"Mask Copy/Rename"
-.PP
-F15 (usually Shift-F5) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the
-selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of
-any tagged files.
-.PP
-On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by
-clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog
-box).  The
-.\"LINK2"
-Background Jobs
-.\"Background jobs"
-is used to control the background process.
-.PP
-.B Link (C-x l)
-.PP
-Create a hard link to the current file.
-.PP
-.B SymLink (C-x s)
-.PP
-Create a symbolic link to the current file. To those of you who don't
-know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying
-the file, but both the source filename and the destination filename
-represent the same file image. For example, if you edit one of these
-files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some people call
-links aliases or shortcuts.
-.PP
-A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of
-telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete
-either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult
-to notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when
-you don't even want to know.
-.PP
-A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If
-the original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite
-easy to notice that the files represent the same image. The Midnight
-Commander shows an "@"-sign in front of the file name if it is a
-symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)).
-The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status line if the
-.I "Show mini-status"
-option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the
-confusion that can be caused by hard links.
-.PP
-.B Rename/Move (F6, F16)
-.PP
-Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or
-the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
-directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination 
-defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details
-look at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.
-.PP
-F16 (usually Shift-F6) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the
-selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of
-any tagged files.
-.PP
-On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by
-clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog
-box).  The
-.\"LINK2"

-.\"Background jobs"
-is used to control the background process.
-.PP
-.B Mkdir (F7)
-.PP
-Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.
-.PP
-.B Delete (F8)
-.PP
-Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the
-currently selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or
-ESC to abort the operation.
-.PP
-.B Quick cd (Alt-c)
-Use the
-.\"LINK2"
-quick cd
-.\"Quick cd"
-command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere.
-.PP
-.B Select group (+)
-.PP
-This is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight Commander
-will prompt for a regular expression describing the group. When
-.I Shell Patterns
-are enabled, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing
-in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing
-for one character). If
-.I Shell Patterns
-is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular
-expressions (see ed (1)).
-.PP
-To mark directories instead of files, the expression must start or end
-with a '/'.
-.PP
-.B Unselect group (\\\\)
-.PP
-Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the
-.I "Select group"
-command.
-.PP
-.B Quit (F10, Shift-F10)
-.PP
-Terminate the Midnight Commander.  Shift-F10 is used when you want to
-quit and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift-F10 will not take you
-to the last directory you visited with the Midnight Commander, instead
-it will stay at the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.
-.\"NODE "    Quick cd"

-This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.
-.PP
-The Compare directories (C-x d) command compares the directory
-panels with each other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make
-the panels identical. There are three compare methods. The quick method
-compares only file size and file date. The thorough method makes a
-full byte-by-byte compare. The thorough method is not available if the
-machine does not support the mmap(2) system call.  The size-only
-compare method just compares the file sizes and does not check the
-contents or the date times, it just checks the file size.

-.\"LINK2"
-External panelize
-.\"External panelize"
-allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that
-program the contents of the current panel.
-.PP
-.\"LINK2"
-Extension file edit
-.\"Extension File Edit"
-command allows you to specify programs to executed when you try to
-execute, view, edit and do a bunch of other thing on files
-with certain extensions (filename endings). The
-.\"LINK2"
-Menu file edit
-.\"Menu File Edit"
-command may be used for editing the user menu (which appears by
-pressing F2).
-.\"NODE "    Directory Tree"
-.SH "    Directory Tree"
-The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories. You
-can select a directory from the figure and the Midnight Commander will
-change to that directory.
-.PP
-There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command
-is available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view
-from the Left or Right menu.
-.PP
-To get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates the tree
-figure by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the
-directory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent
-directory and press C-r (or F2).
-.PP
-You can use the following keys:
-.PP
-.\"LINK2"
-General movement keys
-.\"General Movement Keys"
-are accepted.
-.PP
-.B Enter.
-In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to this
-directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this
-directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the
-current panel.
-.PP
-.B C-r, F2 (Rescan).
-Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date:
-it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which don't
-exist any more.
-.PP
-.B F3 (Forget).
-Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter
-from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree figure
-press F2 in its parent directory.
-.PP
-.B F4 (Static/Dynamic).
-Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static
-navigation mode.
-.PP
-In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to
-select a directory. All known directories are shown.
-.PP
-In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to
-select a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent
-directory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the
-parent, sibling and children directories are shown, others are left
-out. The tree figure changes dynamically as you traverse.
-.PP
-.B F5 (Copy).
-Copy the directory.
-.PP
-.B F6 (RenMov).
-Move the directory.
-.PP
-.B F7 (Mkdir).
-Make a new directory below this directory.
-.PP
-.B F8 (Delete).
-Delete this directory from the file system.
-.PP
-.B C-s, Alt-s.
-Search the next directory matching the search string. If there is
-no such directory these keys will move one line down.
-.PP
-.B C-h, Backspace.
-Delete the last character of the search string.
-.PP
-.B Any other character.
-Add the character to the search string and move to the next directory
-which starts with these characters. In the tree view you must first
-activate the search mode by pressing C-s. The search string is shown
-in the mini status line.
-.PP
-The following actions are available only in the directory tree. They
-aren't supported in the tree view.
-.PP
-.B F1 (Help).
-Invoke the help viewer and show this section.
-.PP
-.B Esc, F10.
-Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.
-.PP
-The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See
-also the section on
-.\"LINK2"
-mouse support\&.
-.\"Mouse Support"
-.\"NODE "    Find File"
-.SH "    Find File"
-The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the
-search and the filename to be searched for. By pressing the Tree
-button you can select the start directory from the
-.\"LINK2"
-directory tree
-.\"Directory Tree"
-figure.
-.PP
-The contents field accepts regular expressions similar to egrep(1). That
-means you have to escape characters with a special meaning to egrep with "\\",
-e.g. if you search for "strcmp (" you will have to input "strcmp \\("
-(without the double quotes).
-.PP
-You can start the search by pressing the OK button.
-During the search you can stop from the Stop button and continue from
-the Start button.
-.PP
-You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir
-button will change to the directory of the currently selected
-file. The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new
-search. The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize
-button will place the found files to the current directory panel so
-that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move,
-delete and so on). After panelizing you can press C-r to return to the
-normal file listing.
-.PP
-It is possible to have a list of directories that the Find File command
-should skip during the search (for example, you may want to avoid
-searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow
-link).
-.PP
-Directories to be skipped should be set on the variable
-.B find_ignore_dirs
-in the
-.B Misc
-section of your ~/.mc/ini file.
-.PP
-Directory components should be separated with a colon, here is an
-example:
-.PP
-.nf
-[Misc]
-find_ignore_dirs=/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs
-.fi
-.PP
-You may consider using the
-.\"LINK2"
-External panelize
-.\"External panelize"
-command for some operations. Find file command is for simple queries
-only, while using External panelize you can do as mysterious searches
-as you would like.
-.\"NODE "    External panelize"
-.SH "    External panelize"
-The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and
-make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.
-.PP
-For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the
-symbolic links in the current directory, you can use external
-panelization to run the following command:
-.PP
-.nf
-find . -type l -print
-.fi
-.PP
-Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no
-longer be the directory listing of the current directory, but all the
-files that are symbolic links.
-.PP
-If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded
-from your FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file
-name from the transfer log files:
-.PP
-.nf
-awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /usr/adm/xferlog
-.fi
-.PP
-You may want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name,
-so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the command on
-the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name under
-which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that
-command from the list and do not have to type it again.
-.\"NODE "    Hotlist"
-.SH "    Hotlist"
-The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories
-in the directory hotlist.  The Midnight Commander will change to the
-directory corresponding to the selected label.  From the hotlist dialog,
-you can remove already created label/directory pairs and add new ones.
-To add new directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command
-(C-x h), which adds the current directory into the directory hotlist,
-asking just for the label for the directory.
-.PP
-This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the
-CDPATH variable as described in
-.\"LINK2"
-internal cd command
-.\"The cd internal command"
-description.
-.\"NODE "    Extension File Edit"
-.SH "    Extension File Edit"
-This will invoke your editor on the file
-.IR ~/.mc/bindings .
-The format of this file following:
-.PP
-All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.
-.PP
-Lines starting in the first column should have following format:
-.PP
-.IR keyword/expr ,
-i.e. everything after the slash until new line is
-.IR expr .
-.PP
-.I keyword
-can be:
-.TP
-.I shell
-\-
-.I expr
-is an extension (no wildcards).  File matches it its name ends
-with
-.IR expr .
-Example:
-.I shell/.tar
-matches
-.IR *.tar .
-.TP
-.I regex
-\-
-.I expr
-is a regular expression.  File matches if its name matches the regular
-expression.
-.TP
-.I directory
-\-
-.I expr
-is a regular expression.  File matches if it is a directory and its name
-matches the regular expression.
-.TP
-.I type
-\-
-.I expr
-is a regular expression.  File matches if the output of
-.I file %f
-without the initial "filename:" part matches regular expression
-.IR expr .
-.TP
-.I default
-\- matches any file.
-.I expr
-is ignored.
-.TP
-.I include
-\- denotes a common section.
-.I expr
-is the name of the section.
-.PP
-Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the format:
-.I keyword=command
-(with no spaces around =), where
-.I keyword
-should be:
-.I Open
-(invoked on Enter or double click),
-.I View
-(F3),
-.I Edit
-(F4) or
-.I Include
-(to add rules from the common section).
-.I command
-is any one-line shell command, with the simple
-.\"LINK2"
-macro substitution\&.
-.\"Macro Substitution"
-.PP
-Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is important.  If
-the appropriate action is missing, search continues as if this rule
-didn't match (i.e. if a file matches the first and second entry and View
-action is missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View action
-from the second entry will be used).
-.I default
-should match all the actions.
-.\"NODE "    Background jobs"
-.SH "    Background Jobs"
-This lets you control the state of any background Midnight Commander
-process (only copy and move files operations can be done in the
-background).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from
-here.
-.\"NODE "    Menu File Edit"
-.SH "    Menu File Edit"
-The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by
-the user. When you access the user menu, the
-file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it exists,
-but only if it is owned by user or root and is not world-writable.
-If no such file found, ~/.mc/menu is tried in the same way,
-and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu
-@prefix@/share/mc/mc.menu.
-.PP
-The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with
-anything but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in
-order to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should
-be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are the
-commands that will be executed when the entry is selected.
-.PP
-When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are
-copied to a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually
-/usr/tmp) and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put
-normal shell constructs in the menus. Also simple macro substitution
-takes place before executing the menu code. For more information, see
-.\"LINK2"
-macro substitution\&.
-.\"Macro Substitution"
-.PP
-Here is a sample mc.menu file:
-.PP
-.nf
-A	Dump the currently selected file
-	od -c %f
-
-B	Edit a bug report and send it to root
-	I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
-	vi $I
-	mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root < $I
-	rm -f $I
-
-M	Read mail
-	emacs -f rmail
-
-N	Read Usenet news
-	emacs -f gnus
-
-H	Call the info hypertext browser
-	info
-
-J	Copy current directory to other panel recursively
-	tar cf - . | (cd %D && tar xvpf -)
-
-K	Make a release of the current subdirectory
-	echo -n "Name of distribution file: "
-	read tar
-	ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar
-	cd ..
-	tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar
-
-= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
-X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
-	tar xzvf %f
-.fi
-.PP
-.B Default Conditions
-.PP
-Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must
-start from the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is
-true, the menu entry will be the default entry.
-.PP
-.nf
-Condition syntax: 	= <sub-cond>
-  or:			= <sub-cond> | <sub-cond> ...
-  or:			= <sub-cond> & <sub-cond> ...
-
-Sub-condition is one of following:
-
-  y <pattern>		syntax of current file matching pattern?
-			(for edit menu only)
-  f <pattern>		current file matching pattern?
-  F <pattern>		other file matching pattern?
-  d <pattern>		current directory matching pattern?
-  D <pattern>		other directory matching pattern?
-  t <type>		current file of type?
-  T <type>		other file of type?
-  x <filename>		is it executable filename?
-  ! <sub-cond>		negate the result of sub-condition
-.fi
-.PP
-Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according
-to the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of
-the shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first
-line of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).
-.PP
-Type is one or more of the following characters:
-.PP
-.nf
-  n	not a directory
-  r	regular file
-  d	directory
-  l	link
-  c	character device
-  b	block device
-  f	FIFO (pipe)
-  s	socket
-  x	executable file
-  t	tagged
-.fi
-.PP
-For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't'
-type is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the
-file. The condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the
-current panel and false if not.
-.PP
-If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be
-shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.
-.PP
-The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
-.nf
-	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
-.fi
-is calculated as
-.nf
-	( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)
-.fi
-.PP
-Here is a sample of the use of conditions:
-.PP
-.nf
-= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
-L	List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
-	gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -
-.fi
-.PP
-.B Addition Conditions
-.PP
-If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it
-is an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will
-be included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will
-not be included in the menu.
-.PP
-You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition
-with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you
-want to use two different conditions, one for adding and another for
-defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one
-starting with '+' and another starting with '='.
-.PP
-Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must start
-with '#', space or tab.
-.\"NODE "  Options Menu"
-.SH "  Options Menu"
-The Midnight Commander has some options that may be toggled on and
-off in several dialogs which are accessible from this menu. Options
-are enabled if they have an asterisk or "x" in front of them.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Configuration
-.\"Configuration"
-command pops up a dialog from which you can change most of settings of
-the Midnight Commander.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Layout
-.\"Layout"
-command pops up a dialog from which you specify a bunch of options how mc
-looks like on the screen.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Confirmation
-.\"Confirmation"
-command pops up a dialog from which you specify which actions you want to
-confirm.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Display bits
-.\"Display bits"
-command pops up a dialog from which you may select which characters is your
-terminal able to display.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Learn keys
-.\"Learn keys"
-command pops up a dialog from which you test some keys which are not working
-on some terminals and you may fix them.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Virtual FS
-.\"Virtual FS"
-command pops up a dialog from which you specify some VFS related options.
-.PP
-The
-.\"LINK2"
-Save setup
-.\"Save Setup"
-command saves the current settings of the Left, Right and Options
-menus. A small number of other settings is saved, too.
-.\"NODE "    Configuration"
-.SH "    Configuration"
-The options in this dialog are divided into three groups:
-Panel Options, Pause after run and Other Options.
-.PP
-.B Panel Options
-.PP
-.I Show Backup Files.
-If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde.
-Otherwise, they won't be shown (like GNU's ls option -B).
-.PP
-.I Show Hidden Files.
-If enabled, the Midnight Commander will show all files that start with
-a dot (like ls -a).
-.PP
-.I Mark moves down.
-If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you mark a file (with
-either C-t or the Insert key).
-.PP
-.I Drop down menus.
-When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as
-soon as you press the
-.B F9
-key.  Otherwise, you will only get the menu title, and you will have
-to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or with the hotkeys.
-It is recommended if you are using hotkeys.
-.PP
-.I Mix all files.
-If this option is enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed
-together.  If the option is off, directories (and links to directories)
-are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files below.
-.PP
-.I Fast directory reload.
-If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander will use a trick to
-determine if the directory contents have changed.  The trick is to reload
-the directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this means
-that reloads only happen when files are created or deleted.  If what
-changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes,
-mode or owner changes, etc) the display is not updated.  In these cases,
-if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory manually
-(with C-r).
-.PP
-.B Pause after run
-.PP
-After executing your commands, the Midnight Commander can pause, so
-that you can examine the output of the command.  There are three
-possible settings for this variable:
-.PP
-.I Never.
-Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If you
-are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to
-see the output of the command by typing C-o.
-.PP
-.I On dumb terminals.
-You will get the pause message on terminals that are not capable of
-showing the output of the last command executed (any terminal that is
-not an xterm or the Linux console).
-.PP
-.I Always.
-The program will pause after executing all of your commands.
-.PP
-.B Other Options
-.PP
-.I Verbose operation.
-This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are
-verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If you have a
-slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is
-automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than
-9600 bps.
-.PP
-.I Compute totals.
-If this option is enabled, the Midnight
-Commander computes total byte sizes and total number of files
-prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This will
-provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense
-of some speed. This option has no effect, if
-.I Verbose operation
-is disabled.
-.PP
-.I Shell Patterns.
-By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like
-regular expressions. The following conversions are performed to achieve
-this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the '?'
-is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the literal
-dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the
-ones described in ed(1).
-.PP
-.I Auto Save Setup.
-If this option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight Commander the
-configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved in the
-~/.mc/ini file.
-.PP
-.I Auto menus.
-If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup.
-Useful for building menus for non-unixers.
-.PP
-.I Use internal editor.
-If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit
-files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in the
-.B EDITOR
-environment variable is used.
-If no editor is specified,
-.B vi
-is used.  See the section on the
-.\"LINK2"
-internal file editor\&.
-.\"Internal File Editor"
-.PP
-.I Use internal viewer.
-If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view
-files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the
-.B PAGER
-environment variable is used.
-If no pager is specified, the
-.B view
-command is used.  See the section on the
-.\"LINK2"
-internal file viewer\&.
-.\"Internal File Viewer"
-.PP
-.I Complete: show all.
-By default the Midnight Commander pops up all possible
-.\"LINK2"
-completions
-.\"Completion"
-if the completion is ambiguous only when you press
-.B Alt-Tab
-for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much as
-possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if you
-want to see all possible completions even after pressing
-.B Alt-Tab
-the first time.
-.PP
-.I Rotating dash.
-If this option is enabled, the
-Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner
-as a work in progress indicator.
-.PP
-.I Lynx-like motion.
-If this option is enabled,
-you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the
-current selection is a subdirectory and the shell command
-line is empty. By default, this setting is off.
-.PP
-.I Cd follows links.
-This option, if set, causes the Midnight Commander to follow the
-logical chain of directories when changing current directory
-either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default
-behavior of bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows the
-real directory structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory
-through a link will move you to the current directory's real parent
-and not to the directory where the link was present.
-.PP
-.I Safe delete.
-If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries
-unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The default selection in the
-confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from "Yes" to "No".
-This option is disabled by default.
-.\"NODE "    Layout"
-.SH "    Layout"
-The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout
-of screen. You can specify whether the menubar, the command prompt, the
-hintbar and the function keybar are visible. On the Linux or FreeBSD
-console you can specify how many lines are shown in the output window.
-.PP
-The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You
-can specify whether the area is split to the panels in vertical or
-horizontal direction. The split can be equal or you can specify an
-unequal split.
-.PP
-You can specify whether
-.I permissions
-and
-.I file types
-should be highlighted with distinctive
-.\"LINK2"
-Colors\&.
-.\"Colors"
-If the permission highlighting is enabled, the parts of the
-.I perm
-and
-.I mode
-.\"LINK2"
-display fields
-.\"Listing Mode..."
-which apply to the user running Midnight Commander are highlighted with
-the color defined by the
-.I selected
-keyword.  If the file type highlighting is enabled, files are colored
-according to their file type (e.g. directory, core file, executable,
-and so on).
-.PP
-If the
-.I Show Mini-Status
-option is enabled, one line of status information about the currently
-selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels.
-.PP
-When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the
-terminal window title to the current working directory and updates it
-when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is broken and you see some
-incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off the
-.I Xterm Window Title
-option.
-.\"NODE "    Confirmation"
-.SH "    Confirmation"
-In this menu you configure the confirmation options for file deletion,
-directory hotlist entries deletion, overwriting, execution by pressing
-enter and quitting the program.
-.\"NODE "    Display bits"
-.SH "    Display bits"
-This is used to configure the range of visible characters on the
-screen.  This setting may be 7-bits if your terminal/curses supports
-only seven output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the
-ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display
-full 8 bit characters.
-.\"NODE "    Learn keys"
-.SH "    Learn keys"
-This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor
-arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal.
-They often don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken.
-.PP
-You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys ('h'
-left, 'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right).  Once you press any cursor movement
-key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.
-.PP
-You can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a
-key and it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name
-of that key.  Once a key is marked OK it starts working as usually,
-e.g. F1 pressed the first time will just check that the F1 key works,
-but after that it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.
-The Tab key should be working always.
-.PP
-If some keys do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after
-pressing one of these.  Then you may want to redefine it.  Do it by pressing
-the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or by Enter
-or Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then a message
-box will appear asking you to press that key.  Do it and wait until the
-message box disappears.  If you want to abort, just press Escape once
-and wait.
-.PP
-When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions
-for the keys you have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM]
-section of your ~/.mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of your current
-terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were already working properly
-are not saved.
-.\"NODE "    Virtual FS"
-.SH "    Virtual FS"
-This option gives you control over the settings of the
-.\"LINK2"
-Virtual File System\&.
-.\"Virtual File System"
-.PP
-The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some
-of the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the
-file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).
-.PP
-Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example,
-compressed tar files) the Midnight Commander needs to create temporary
-uncompressed files on your disk.
-.PP
-Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk
-take up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached
-information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of
-access to frequently used file systems.
-.PP
-Because of the format of the tar archives, the
-.I Tar filesystem
-needs to read the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most
-tar files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in
-extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk
-in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a
-regular tar file.
-.PP
-Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk,

-not using spam filtering.
-.PP
-ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache. 
-The cache expire time is configurable with the
-.I ftpfs directory cache timeout
-option.  A low value for this option may slow down every operation on
-the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the
-FTP server.
-.PP
-You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern
-firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so
-FTP proxies are considered obsolete.

-is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain
-hosts.  See
-.\"LINK2"
-FTP File System
-.\"FTP File System"
-for examples.
-.PP
-If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the
-@prefix@/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that
-are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a
-domain) and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are
-directly accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the
-specified FTP proxy.
-.PP
-You can enable using
-.I ~/.netrc
-file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers.  See netrc
-(5) for the description of the .netrc format.
-.PP
-.I Use passive mode
-enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is
-initiated by the client, not by the server.  This option is recommended
-and enabled by default.  If this option is turned off, the data
-connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work with some
-firewalls.
-.\"NODE "    Save Setup"

-on which the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped files
-are left tagged.
-.\"NODE "Mask Copy/Rename"
-.SH "Mask Copy/Rename"
-The copy/move operations let you translate the names of files in an
-easy way.  To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and
-usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards.
-All the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to
-the target mask.  If there are tagged files, only the tagged files
-matching the source mask are renamed.
-.PP
-There are other options which you can set:
-.PP
-.B Follow links
-.PP
-determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source
-directory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target
-directory or whether would you like to copy their content.
-.PP
-.B Dive into subdirs
-.PP
-determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied,
-but the target directory already exists.  The default action is to copy
-the contents of the source directory into the target directory. 
-Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into the
-target directory.
-.PP
-For example, you want to copy directory
-.I /foo
-containing file
-.I bar
-to
-.IR /bla/foo ,
-which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when
-.B Dive into subdirs
-is not set), mc would copy file
-.I /foo/bar
-into the file
-.IR /bla/foo/bar .
-By enabling this option the
-.I /bla/foo/foo
-directory will be created, and
-.I /foo/bar
-will be copied into
-.IR /bla/foo/foo/bar .
-.PP
-.B Preserve attributes
-.PP
-determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you
-are root) the ownership of the original files.  If this option is not
-set, the current value of the umask will be respected.
-.PP
-.B Use shell patterns on
-.PP
-When the shell patterns option is on you can use the '*' and '?'
-wildcards in the source mask.  They work like they do in the shell.  In
-the target mask only the '*' and '\\<digit>' wildcards are allowed.  The
-first '*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard
-group in the source mask, the second '*' corresponds to the second group
-and so on.  The '\\1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group
-in the source mask, the '\\2' wildcard corresponds to the second group
-and so on all the way up to '\\9'.  The '\\0' wildcard is the whole
-filename of the source file.
-.PP
-Two examples:
-.PP
-If the source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the
-file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".
-.PP
-Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would
-become "c.file" and so on.  The source mask for this is "*.*" and the
-destination is "\\2.\\1".
-.PP
-.B Use shell patterns off
-.PP
-When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn't do automatic
-grouping anymore. You must use '\\(...\\)' expressions in the source
-mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is
-more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks
-are similar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.
-.PP
-Two examples:
-.PP
-If the source mask is "^\\(.*\\)\\.tar\\.gz$", the destination is
-"/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy
-will be "/bla/foo.tgz".
-.PP
-Let's suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c"
-will become "c.file" and so on. The source mask for this is
-"^\\(.*\\)\\.\\(.*\\)$" and the destination is "\\2.\\1".
-.PP
-.B Case Conversions
-.PP
-You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '\\u'
-or '\\l' in the target mask, the next character will be converted to
-uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.
-.PP
-If you use '\\U' or '\\L' in the target mask, the next characters will
-be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the
-next '\\E' or next '\\U', '\\L' or the end of the file name.
-.PP
-The '\\u' and '\\l' are stronger than '\\U' and '\\L'.
-.PP
-For example, if the source mask is '*' (shell patterns on) or '^\\(.*\\)$'
-(shell patterns off) and the target mask is '\\L\\u*' the file names
-will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case.
-.PP
-You can also use '\\' as a quote character. For example, '\\\\' is
-a backslash and '\\*' is an asterisk.

-.fi
-.PP
-The last line specifies that the third and then the second
-number are to be used in place of the first and second.
-.PP
-It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt on replace on, because
-a match is thought to be found whenever the number of arguments found
-matches the number given, which is not always a real match. Scanf also
-treats whitespace as being elastic.  Note that the scanf format %[ is
-very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.

-(for manipulating files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh) and
-finally the
-.I mcfs
-(Midnight Commander file system), a network based file system.  If the
-code was compiled with
-.I smbfs
-support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the SMB (CIFS)
-protocol.
-.PP
-A generic
-.I extfs
-(EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand
-VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.
-.PP
-The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will
-forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one
-of the file systems is described later in their own section.
-.\"NODE "  FTP File System"
-.SH "  FTP File System"
-The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote
-machines.  To actually use it, you can use the
-.I FTP link
-item in the menu or directly change your current directory using the
-.I cd
-command to a path name that looks like this:
-.PP
-.I /#ftp:[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]
-.PP
-The
-.IR user ,
-.I port
-and
-.I remote-dir
-elements are optional.  If you specify the
-.I user
-element, the Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as that
-user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name from the
-.I ~/.netrc
-file.  The optional
-.I pass
-element is the password used for the connection.  Using the password in
-the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the
-screen in clear text and can be saved to the directory history.
-.PP
-To enable using FTP proxy, prepend
-.B !
-(an exclamation sign) to the hostname.
-.PP
-Examples:
-.PP
-.nf
-    /#ftp:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
-    /#ftp:tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
-    /#ftp:!behind.firewall.edu/pub
-    /#ftp:guest@remote-host.com:40/pub

-.PP
-Please check the
-.\"LINK2"
-Virtual File System
-.\"Virtual FS"
-dialog box for ftpfs options.
-.\"NODE "  Tar File System"
-.SH "  Tar File System"
-The tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar
-files and compressed tar files by using the chdir command.  To change
-your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to the
-tar file by using the following syntax:
-.PP
-.I /filename.tar#utar/[dir-inside-tar]
-.PP
-The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means
-that usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter
-into the tar file, see the
-.\"LINK2"
-Extension File Edit
-.\"Extension File Edit"
-section for details on how this is done.
-.PP
-Examples:
-.PP
-.nf
-    mc-3.0.tar.gz#utar/mc-3.0/vfs
-    /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar#utar
-.fi
-.PP
-The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.
-.\"NODE "  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem"
-.SH "  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem"
-The fish file system is a network based file system that allows you to
-manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use
-this, the other side has to either run fish server, or has to have
-bash-compatible shell.
-.PP
-To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir
-into a special directory which name is in the following
-format:
-.PP
-.I /#sh:[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]
-.PP
-The
-.I user,
-.I options
-and
-.I remote-dir
-elements are optional.  If you specify the
-.I user
-element, the Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote
-machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.
-.PP
-The
-.I options
-are 'C' - use compression and 'rsh' use rsh instead of ssh.  If the
-.I remote-dir
-element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be
-set to this one.
-.PP
-Examples:
-.PP
-.nf
-    /#sh:onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
-    /#sh:joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
-    /#sh:joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
-.fi
-.\"NODE "  Network File System"
-.SH "  Network File System"
-The Midnight Commander file system is a network base file system that
-allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were
-local.  To use this, the remote machine must be running the mcserv(8)
-server program.
-.PP
-To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special
-directory which name is in the following format:
-.PP
-.I /#mc:[user@]machine[:port][remote-dir]
-.PP
-The
-.I user, port
-and
-.I remote-dir
-elements are optional.  If you specify the
-.I user
-element then the Midnight Commander will try to logon on the remote
-machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.
-.PP
-The
-.I port
-element is used when the remote server is running on a special port
-(see the mcserv(8) manual page for more information about ports);
-finally, if the
-.I remote-dir
-element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will
-be set to this one.

-.\"NODE "  Undelete File System"
-.SH "  Undelete File System"
-On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs undelete
-facilities, you will have the undelete file system available.
-Recovery of deleted files is only available on ext2 file systems.  The
-undelete file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to
-retrieve all of the deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and
-to extract the selected files into a regular partition.
-.PP
-To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special file name
-formed by the "/#undel" prefix and the file name where the actual
-file system resides.
-.PP
-For example, to recover deleted files on the second partition of the
-first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name:
-.PP
-.nf
-    /#undel:sda2
-.fi
-.PP
-It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required information
-before you start browsing files there.
-.\"NODE "  SMB File System"
-.SH "  SMB File System"
-The smbfs allows you to manipulate files on remote machines with SMB
-(or CIFS) protocol.  These include Windows for Workgroups,
-Windows 9x/ME/XP, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Samba.
-To actually use it, you may try to use the panel command "SMB link..."
-(accessible from the menubar) or you may directly change your current
-directory to it using the cd command to a path name that looks like this:
-.PP
-.I /#smb:[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]
-.PP
-The
-.IR user ,
-.I service
-and

-.\"NODE "  EXTernal File System"
-.SH "  EXTernal File System"
-.B extfs
-allows to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight
-Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.
-.PP
-Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:
-.PP
-1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing
-file.  They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree.
-You can invoke them by typing
-.RI ' "cd #fsname" '
-where fsname is an extfs short name (see below).  Examples of such
-filesystems include audio (list audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of
-all Debian packages in the system).
-.PP
-For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type
-.PP
-.nf
-  cd #audio
-.fi
-.PP
-2. 'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent
-contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of 'real' files
-compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages
-in a mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such
-filesystems
-.RI ' #fsname '
-should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the archive itself
-can be on another vfs.
-.PP
-For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type
-.PP
-.nf
-  cd documents.zip#uzip
-.fi
-.PP
-In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For
-instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from directory
-history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell
-commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.
-.PP
-Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:
-.TP
-.B a
-access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette
-.RI ( "cd #a" ).
-.TP
-.B apt
-front end to Debian's APT package management system
-.RI ( "cd #apt" ).
-.TP
-.B audio
-audio CD ripping and playing
-.RI ( "cd #audio"
-or
-.IR "cd device#audio" ).
-.TP
-.B bpp
-package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution
-.RI ( "cd file.bpp#bpp" ).
-.TP
-.B deb
-package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution
-.RI ( "cd file.deb#deb" ).
-.TP
-.B dpkg
-Debian GNU/Linux installed packages
-.RI ( "cd #deb" ).
-.TP
-.B hp48
-view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator
-.RI ( "cd #hp48" ).
-.TP
-.B lslR
-browsing of lslR listings as found on many FTPs
-.RI ( "cd filename#lslR" ).
-.TP
-.B mailfs
-mbox-style mailbox files support
-.RI ( "cd mailbox#mailfs" ).
-.TP
-.B patchfs
-extfs to handle unified and context diffs
-.RI ( "cd filename#patchfs" ).
-.TP
-.B rpm
-RPM package
-.RI ( "cd filename#rpm" ).
-.TP
-.B rpms
-RPM database management
-.RI ( "cd #rpms" ).
-.TP
-.B ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha
-archivers
-.RI ( "cd archive#xxxx"
-where xxxx is one of:
-.IR ulha ,
-.IR urar ,
-.IR uzip ,
-.IR uzoo ,
-.IR uar ,
-.IR uha ).
-.PP
-You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as described in the
-.\"LINK2"

-.\"NODE "Colors"
-.SH "Colors"
-The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports
-color using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes
-it gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode
-using the -c and -b flag respectively.
-.PP
-If the program is compiled with the Slang screen manager instead of
-ncurses, it will also check the variable
-.B COLORTERM,
-if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c flag.
-.PP
-You may specify terminals that always force color mode
-by adding the
-.I color_terminals
-variable to the Colors section of the initialization file.  This will
-prevent the Midnight Commander from trying to detect if your terminal
-supports color.  Example:
-.PP
-.nf
-[Colors]
-color_terminals=linux,xterm
-color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...
-.fi
-.PP
-The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang, ncurses does
-not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the
-information in the terminal database.
-.PP
-The Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors.
-Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable
-.B MC_COLOR_TABLE
-or the Colors section in the initialization file.
-.PP
-In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the
-.I base_color
-variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal by
-using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:
-.PP
-.nf
-[Colors]
-base_color=
-xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red
-.fi
-.PP
-The format for the color definition is:
-.PP
-.nf
-  <keyword>=<foregroundcolor>,<backgroundcolor>:<keyword>= ...
-.fi
-.PP
-The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, marked,
-markselect, errors, input, reverse, gauge.  Menu colors are: menu,
-menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel.  Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus,
-dhotnormal, dhotfocus.  Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic,
-helpbold, helplink, helpslink.  Viewer color is: viewunderline.  Special
-highlighting colors are: executable, directory, link, stalelink, device,
-special, core.  Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked.
-.PP
-.I input
-determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.
-.PP
-.I gauge
-determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge),
-which is used to show the user the progress of file operations, such as
-copying.
-.PP
-The dialog boxes use the following colors:
-.I dnormal
-is used for the normal text,
-.I dfocus
-is the color used for the currently selected component,
-.I dhotnormal
-is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal
-components, whereas the
-.I dhotfocus
-color is used for the highlighted color in the currently selected
-component.
-.PP
-Menus use the same scheme but uses the menu, menusel, menuhot and
-menuhotsel tags instead.
-.PP
-Help uses the following colors:
-.I helpnormal
-is used for normal text,
-.I helpitalic
-is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual page,
-.I helpbold
-is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual page,
-.I helplink
-is used for not selected hyperlinks and
-.I helpslink
-is used for selected hyperlink.
-.PP
-Special highlight colors determine how files are displayed when file
-highlighting is enabled (see the section on
-.\"LINK2"
-Layout\&).
-.\"Layout"
-.I directory
-is used for directories or symbolic links to directories;
-.I executable
-for executable files;
-.I link
-is used for symbolic links which are neither stale nor linked
-to a directory;
-.I stalelink
-is used for stale symbolic links;
-.I device
-- character and block devices;
-.I special
-is used for special files, such as pipes and sockets;
-.I core
-is for core files.
-.PP
-The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green,
-brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta,
-cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword
-for transparent background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be
-used for background color. Example:
-.PP
-.nf
-[Colors]
-base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default
-.fi
-.\"NODE "Special Settings"
-.SH "Special Settings"
-Most of the settings of the Midnight Commander can be changed from the
-menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be
-changed by editing the setup file.
-.PP
-These variables may be set in your ~/.mc/ini file:
-.TP
-.I clear_before_exec
-By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a
-command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the command at the
-bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.mc/ini file and change the value of
-the field clear_before_exec to 0.
-.TP
-.I confirm_view_dir
-If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If
-this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before changing
-the directory if you have files tagged.
-.TP
-.I ftpfs_retry_seconds
-This value is the number of seconds the Midnight Commander will wait
-before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the
-login.  If the value is zero, the login will no be retried.
-.TP
-.I max_dirt_limit
-Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal
-file viewer.  Normally this value is not significant, because the code
-automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the
-rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on very slow machines or
-terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen
-updates too jumpy.
-.IP
-It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior,
-and that is the default value.
-.TP
-.I mouse_move_pages
-Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by
-line on the panels.
-.TP
-.I mouse_move_pages_viewer
-Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line
-on the internal file viewer.
-.TP
-.I old_esc_mode
-By default the Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix
-(old_esc_mode=0).  If this option is set (old_esc_mode=1), the ESC key
-will act as a prefix key for one second, and if no extra keys have
-arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).
-.TP
-.I only_leading_plus_minus
-Allow special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in the command line (select,
-unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line is empty.  You
-don't need to quote those characters in the middle of the command line.
-On the other hand, you cannot use them to change selection when the
-command line is not empty.
-.TP
-.I panel_scroll_pages
-If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the
-cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, otherwise it
-will just scroll a file at a time.
-.TP
-.I show_output_starts_shell
-This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support.
-When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this
-one is set, you will get a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing any key
-will bring you back to the Midnight Commander.
-.TP
-.I torben_fj_mode
-If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly
-different on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the first
-and last files in the panels, they will act as follows:
-.IP
-The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the
-top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case it will go
-to the first file in the panel.
-.IP
-The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over
-it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom
-line, in such case it will move the selection to the last file name in
-the panel.
-.TP
-.I use_file_to_guess_type
-If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to
-match the file types listed on the
-.\"LINK2"
-mc.ext file\&.
-.\"Extension File Edit"
-.TP
-.I xterm_mode
-If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system
-on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload the other panel with the
-contents of the selected directory.
-.TP
-.I fish_directory_timeout
-This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The
-default value is 900 seconds.
-.\"NODE "Terminal databases"
-.SH "Terminal databases"
-The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal
-database without requiring root privileges.  The Midnight Commander
-searches in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in
-the Midnight Commander library directory) and in the ~/.mc/ini file for
-the section "terminal:your-terminal-name" and then for the section
-"terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that
-you want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the
-key.  You can use the special \\e form to represent the escape character
-and the ^x to represent the control-x character.
-.PP
-The possible key symbols are:
-.PP
-.nf
-f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
-bs            backspace
-home          home key
-end           end key
-up            up arrow key
-down          down arrow key
-left          left arrow key
-right         right arrow key
-pgdn          page down key
-pgup          page up key
-insert        the insert character
-delete        the delete character
-complete      to do completion
-.fi
-.PP
-For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you
-set this in the ini file:
-.PP
-.nf
-insert=\\e[Op
-.fi
-.PP
-The
-.I complete
-key symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion
-process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do
-the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys
-everywhere).

-.SH FEATURES
-The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can
-edit files up to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files. 
-The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut,
-paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro
-commands; regular expression search and replace (and our own
-scanf-printf search and replace); shift-arrow text highlighting (if
-supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap;
-autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file
-types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like
-indent and ispell.
-.SH KEYS
-The editor is easy to use and can be used without learning.  The
-pull-down menu is invoked by pressing F9.  You can learn other keys from
-the menu and from the button bar labels.
-.PP
-In addition to that, Shift combined with arrows does text highlighting
-(if supported by the terminal):
-.B Ctrl-Ins
-copies to the file
-.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip ,
-.B Shift-Ins
-pastes from
-.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip ,
-.B Shift-Del
-cuts to
-.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.clip ,
-and
-.B Ctrl-Del
-deletes highlighted text.  Mouse highlighting also works on some
-terminals.  To use the standard mouse support provided by your terminal,
-hold the Shift key.  Please note that the mouse support in the terminal
-doesn't share the clipboard with
-.BR mcedit .
-.PP
-The completion key (usually
-.B "Alt-Tab"
-or
-.BR "Escape Tab" )
-completes the word under the cursor using the words used earlier in the
-file.
-.PP
-To define a macro, press
-.B Ctrl-R
-and then type out the keys you want to be executed.  Press
-.B Ctrl-R
-again when finished.  You can then assign the macro to any key you like
-by pressing that key.  The macro is executed when you press
-.B Ctrl-A
-and then the assigned key.  The macro is also executed if you press
-Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not
-used for any other function.  The macro commands are stored in the file
-.BR ~/.mc/cedit/cooledit.macros .
-Do NOT edit this file if you are going to use macros again in the same
-editing session, because
-.B mcedit
-caches macro key defines in memory.
-.B mcedit
-now overwrites a macro if a macro with the same key already exists,
-so you won't have to edit this file. You will also have to restart
-other running editors for macros to take effect.
-.P
-.B F19
-will format C, C++, Java or HTML code when it is highlighted.  An executable
-file called
-.B ~/.mc/cedit/edit.indent.rc
-will be created for you from the default template.  Feel free to edit it
-if you need.
-.PP
-.B C-p
-will run ispell on a block of text in a similar way.  The script file
-will be called
-.BR ~/.mc/cedit/edit.spell.rc .
-.PP
-If some keys don't work, you can use
-.B Learn Keys
-in the
-.B Options
-menu.
-.SH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
-.B mcedit
-supports syntax highlighting.  This means that keywords and contexts
-(like C comments, string constants, etc) are highlighted in different
-colors.  The following section explains the format of the file
-.BR ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax .
-If this file is missing, system-wide
-.B @prefix@/share/mc/syntax/Syntax
-is used.
-The file
-.B ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax
-is rescanned on opening of a any new editor file.  The file contains
-rules for highlighting, each of which is given on a separate line, and
-define which keywords will be highlighted to what color.
-.PP
-The file is divided into sections, each beginning with a line with the
-.B file
-command.  The sections are normally put into separate files using the
-.B include
-command.
-.PP
-The
-.B file
-command has three arguments.  The first argument is a regular expression
-that is applied to the file name to determine if the following section
-applies to the file.  The second argument is the description of the file
-type.  It is used in
-.BR cooledit ;
-future versions of
-.B mcedit
-may use it as well.  The third optional argument is a regular expression
-to match the first line of text of the file.  The rules in the following
-section apply if either the file name or the first line of text matches.
-.PP
-A section ends with the start of another section.  Each section is
-divided into contexts, and each context contains rules.  A context is a
-scope within the text that a particular set of rules belongs to.  For
-instance, the text within a C style comment (i.e. between
-.B /*
-and
-.BR */ )
-has its own color.  This is a context, although it has no further rules
-inside it because there is probably nothing that we want highlighted
-within a C comment.
-.PP
-A trivial C programming section might look like this:
-.PP
-.nf
-file .\\*\\\\.c C\\sProgram\\sFile (#include|/\\\\\\*)
-
-wholechars abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_
-
-# default colors
-define  comment   brown
-context default
-  keyword  whole  if       yellow
-  keyword  whole  else     yellow
-  keyword  whole  for      yellow
-  keyword  whole  while    yellow
-  keyword  whole  do       yellow
-  keyword  whole  switch   yellow
-  keyword  whole  case     yellow
-  keyword  whole  static   yellow
-  keyword  whole  extern   yellow
-  keyword         {        brightcyan
-  keyword         }        brightcyan
-  keyword         '*'      green
-
-# C comments
-context /\\* \\*/ comment
-
-# C preprocessor directives
-context linestart # \\n red
-  keyword  \\\\\\n  brightred
-
-# C string constants
-context " " green
-  keyword  %d    brightgreen
-  keyword  %s    brightgreen
-  keyword  %c    brightgreen
-  keyword  \\\\"   brightgreen
-.fi
-.PP
-Each context starts with a line of the form:
-.PP
-.B context
-.RB [ exclusive ]
-.RB [ whole | wholeright | wholeleft ]
-.RB [ linestart ]
-.I delim
-.RB [ linestart ]
-.I delim
-.RI [ foreground ]
-.RI [ background ]
-.PP
-The first context is an exception.  It must start with the command
-.PP
-.B context default
-.RI [ foreground ]
-.RI [ background ]
-.PP
-otherwise
-.B mcedit
-will report an error.  The
-.B linestart
-option specifies that
-.I delim
-must start at the beginning of a line.  The
-.B whole
-option tells that
-.I delim
-must be a whole word.  To specify that a word must begin on the word
-boundary only on the left side, you can use the
-.B wholeleft
-option, and similarly a word that must end on the word boundary is specified by
-.BR wholeright .
-.PP
-The set of characters that constitute a whole word can be changed at any
-point in the file with the
-.B wholechars
-command.  The left and right set of characters can be set separately
-with
-.PP
-.B wholechars
-.RB [ left | right ]
-.I characters
-.PP
-The
-.B exclusive
-option causes the text between the delimiters to be highlighted, but not
-the delimiters themselves.
-.PP
-Each rule is a line of the form:
-.PP
-.B keyword
-.RB [ whole | wholeright | wholeleft ]
-.RB [ linestart ]
-.I string foreground
-.RI [ background ]
-.PP
-Context or keyword strings are interpreted, so that you can include tabs
-and spaces with the sequences \\t and \\s.  Newlines and backslashes are
-specified with \\n and \\\\ respectively.  Since whitespace is used as a
-separator, it may not be used as is.  Also, \\* must be used to specify
-an asterisk.  The * itself is a wildcard that matches any length of
-characters.  For example,
-.PP
-.nf
-  keyword         '*'      green
-.fi
-.PP
-colors all C single character constants green.  You also could use
-.PP
-.nf
-  keyword         "*"      green
-.fi
-.PP
-to color string constants, but the matched string would not be allowed
-to span across multiple newlines.  The wildcard may be used within
-context delimiters as well, but you cannot have a wildcard as the last
-or first character.
-.PP
-Important to note is the line
-.PP
-.nf
-  keyword  \\\\\\n  brightgreen
-.fi
-.PP
-This line defines a keyword containing the backslash and newline
-characters.  Since the keywords are matched before the context
-delimiters, this keyword prevents the context from ending at the end of
-the lines that end in a backslash, thus allowing C preprocessor
-directive to continue across multiple lines.
-.PP
-The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green,
-brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta,
-cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white.  If the syntax file is shared
-with
-.BR cooledit ,
-it is possible to specify different colors for
-.B mcedit
-and
-.B cooledit
-by separating them with a slash, e.g.
-.PP
-.nf
-keyword  #include  red/Orange
-.fi
-.PP
-.B mcedit
-uses the color before the slash.  See cooledit(1) for supported
-.B cooledit
-colors.
-.PP
-Comments may be put on a separate line starting with the hash sign (#).
-.PP
-Because of the simplicity of the implementation, there are a few
-intricacies that will not be dealt with correctly but these are a minor
-irritation.  On the whole, a broad spectrum of quite complicated
-situations are handled with these simple rules.  It is a good idea to
-take a look at the syntax file to see some of the nifty tricks you can
-do with a little imagination.  If you cannot get by with the rules I
-have coded, and you think you have a rule that would be useful, please
-email me with your request.  However, do not ask for regular expression
-support, because this is flatly impossible.
-.PP
-A useful hint is to work with as much as possible with the things you
-can do rather than try to do things that this implementation cannot deal
-with.  Also remember that the aim of syntax highlighting is to make
-programming less prone to error, not to make code look pretty.
-.SH COLORS
-The default colors may be changed by appending to the
-.B MC_COLOR_TABLE
-environment variable.  Foreground and background colors pairs may be
-specified for example with:
-.PP
-.nf
-MC_COLOR_TABLE="$MC_COLOR_TABLE:\\
-editnormal=lightgray,black:\\
-editbold=yellow,black:\\
-editmarked=black,cyan"
-.fi
-.SH OPTIONS
-Most options can now be set from the editors options dialog box.  See
-the
-.B Options
-menu.  The following options are defined in
-.B ~/.mc/ini
-and have obvious counterparts in the dialog box.  You can modify them to
-change the editor behavior, by editing the file.  Unless specified, a 1
-sets the option to on, and a 0 sets it to off, as is usual.
-.TP
-.I use_internal_edit
-This option is ignored when invoking
-.BR mcedit .
-.TP
-.I editor_key_emulation
-1 for
-.B Emacs
-keys, and 0 for normal
-.B Cooledit
-keys.
-.TP
-.I editor_tab_spacing
-Interpret the tab character as being of this length.
-Default is 8. You should avoid using
-other than 8 since most other editors and text viewers
-assume a tab spacing of 8. Use
-.B editor_fake_half_tabs
-to simulate a smaller tab spacing.
-.TP
-.I editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces
-Never insert a tab space. Rather insert spaces (ascii 20h) to fill to the
-desired tab size.
-.TP
-.I editor_return_does_auto_indent
-Pressing return will tab across to match the indentation
-of the first line above that has text on it.
-.TP
-.I editor_backspace_through_tabs
-Make a single backspace delete all the space to the left
-margin if there is no text between the cursor and the left
-margin.
-.TP
-.I editor_fake_half_tabs
-This will emulate a half tab for those who want to program
-with a tab spacing of 4, but do not want the tab size changed
-from 8 (so that the code will be formatted the same when displayed
-by other programs). When editing between text and the left
-margin, moving and tabbing will be as though a tab space were
-4, while actually using spaces and normal tabs for an optimal fill.
-When editing anywhere else, a normal tab is inserted.
-.TP
-.I editor_option_save_mode
-Possible values 0, 1 and 2.  The save mode (see the options menu also)
-allows you to change the method of saving a file.  Quick save (0) saves
-the file by immediately, truncating the disk file to zero length (i.e.
-erasing it) and the writing the editor contents to the file.  This
-method is fast, but dangerous, since a system error during a file save
-will leave the file only partially written, possibly rendering the data
-irretrievable.  When saving, the safe save (1) option enables creation
-of a temporary file into which the file contents are first written.  In
-the event of an problem, the original file is untouched.  When the
-temporary file is successfully written, it is renamed to the name of the
-original file, thus replacing it.  The safest method is create backups
-(2).  Where a backup file is created before any changes are made.  You
-can specify your own backup file extension in the dialog.  Note that
-saving twice will replace your backup as well as your original file.
-.SH MISCELLANEOUS
-You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace a C format
-string.  First take a look at the
-.B sscanf
-and
-.B sprintf
-man pages to see what a format string is and how it works.  Here's an
-example: suppose that you want to replace all occurrences of an open
-bracket, three comma separated numbers, and a close bracket, with the
-word
-.IR apples ,
-the third number, the word
-.I oranges
-and then the second number.  You would fill in the Replace dialog box as
-follows:
-.PP
-.nf
-.B Enter search string
-(%d,%d,%d)
-.B Enter replace string
-apples %d oranges %d
-.B Enter replacement argument order
-3,2
-.fi
-.PP
-The last line specifies that the third and then the second number are to
-be used in place of the first and second.
-.PP
-It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt On Replace on, because a
-match is thought to be found whenever the number of arguments found
-matches the number given, which is not always a real match. Scanf also
-treats whitespace as being elastic.  Note that the scanf format %[ is
-very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.
-.PP
-The editor also displays non-us characters (160+).  When editing
-binary files, you should set
-.B display bits
-to 7 bits in the Midnight Commander options menu to keep the spacing
-clean.

-.TH mcserv 8 "September 2007" "MC Version 4.6.2-pre1" "GNU Midnight Commander"
-.SH NAME
-mcserv \- Midnight Commander file server.
-.SH USAGE
-.B mcserv
-[\-diqvf] [\-p portnum]
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.LP
-mcserv is the server program for the Midnight Commander networking
-file system.  It provides access to the host file system to clients
-running the Midnight file system (currently, only the Midnight
-Commander file manager).
-.PP
-If the program is run as root the program will try to get a reserved
-port otherwise it will use 9876 as the port.
-.PP
-If the system has a portmapper running, then the port will be
-registered with the portmapper and thus clients will automatically
-connect to the right port.  If the system does not have a portmapper,
-then a port should be manually specified with the -p option (see
-below). 
-.PP
-.SH OPTIONS
-.TP
-.I "-d"
-Become a daemon, you should use this flag if you start the program
-from one of the system startup files.  This flag will make the program
-handle any number of incoming requests by forking a new copy of itself
-for each client.
-.TP
-.I "-q"
-Quiet mode.
-.TP
-.I "-p"
-To make the server listen on the specified 
-.B portnum
-port.
-.TP
-.I "-f"
-Allow ftp authentication as a fallback if the other methods fail.
-This is only useful on systems where the password checking method is not
-supported by this version of mcserv.  The local ftp server is contacted
-with the username and password.  The user is authenticated if the ftp
-server accepts the credentials.  Use this option with care and only
-when necessary.
-.TP
-.I "-v"
-Toggle on the verbose mode.
-.SH LICENSE
-This program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
-License as published by the Free Software Foundation. See the built-in
-help for details on the License and the lack of warranty.
-.SH BUGS
-This program currently uses port 9876, and not a system secure port.
-This is a potential security problem since it could be run by any user
-on the system if the system daemon is not running.
