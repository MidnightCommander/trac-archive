-.B Ctrl\-A
-and then the assigned key.  The macro is also executed if you press
-Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not
-used for any other function.  The macro commands are stored in the file
-.BR ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros .
-Do NOT edit this file if you are going to use macros again in the same
-editing session, because
-.B mcedit
-caches macro key defines in memory.
-.B mcedit
-now overwrites a macro if a macro with the same key already exists,
-so you won't have to edit this file. You will also have to restart
-other running editors for macros to take effect.

+shell script.

+only once per menu file entry or extension file entry, because next time
+there will be no tagged files.
+.TP
+.I %s

+.I %S
+The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the
